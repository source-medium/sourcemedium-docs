### Overview

We know teams are busy, so in this doc we've aggregated what we feel is the most important information you need to get from 0 → 60 with SourceMedium in Looker Studio.

However, if you have the time, we do recommend checking out Looker Studio's quick-start guide [here](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/9171315?hl=en#zippy=) – or, if you're more of a visual learner, [this 20 minute crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coe_f79Xc2o&t=706s)

<Accordion title="Glossary">
    <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Report">
            A Looker Studio asset that contains a collection of **components** whose purpose is to present to viewers information and insights derived from your data.

        <Accordion title="Connector / Data Source">
            **Connectors** connect Looker Studio to your underlying data. Connecting to your data creates a *data source* in Looker Studio.

            **Data sources** represent a particular instance of a connector: for example, a connection to a specific BigQuery table or query, a Google Analytics property, or a Google Sheet. Data sources let you configure the fields and options provided by the connector used to create that connection instance. In addition, the data source gives you a secure way to share information and insights with report viewers who may not be able to directly access the underlying data.

## SourceMedium's Looker Studio templates

If you're on our [Managed Data Warehouse](/data-activation/managed-data-warehouse/overview) solution, SourceMedium provides a suite of template reports and data sources for your business to leverage out-of-the-box.  Learn how to use our Looker Studio templates [here](/data-activation/template-resources/looker-studio-template-copy-instructions), or checkout our template directories:
- [Looker Studio data source templates](/data-activation/template-resources/sm-looker-data-source-template-directory)
- [Looker Studio report templates](/data-activation/template-resources/sm-looker-report-template-directory)

## Creating & Editing Data Sources

Data sources are your report's connection to data that is stored somewhere -- for example your SourceMedium warehouse, a Google Sheet, Google Analytics etc.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Creating new data sources">
        You can provision data sources directly based on tables in your BigQuery warehouse -- e.g. create a new data source out of an entire table like `obt_orders`.  You can also write your own queries to derive new tables based on tables within your warehouse.

        The majority of your data source creation needs will be enabled via data coming from your BigQuery warehouse — using the Looker Studio BigQuery connection -- so that's what we'll focus on in this tutorial.

        You can create new data sources directly from your report, or from your Looker Studio home page.  The steps for configuring your new data source will be the same, regardless of where you initiate the creation process.
        <AccordionGroup>

        **Important Note**: Data sources access underlying data from your warehouse using Data Credentials — essentially, users of the data source will have access to all data the Data Credentials account has access to
            - By default, the account used to create the data source will automatically be assigned as the Data Credentials for that source
            - You can change the Data Credentials for a data source at any time
                - We recommend creating a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) to use as the Data Credential for all of your brand's managed data sources
                    - [Documentation on setting up a service account for Looker Studio](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/10835295?sjid=1005066725261683010-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Data source hygiene & best practices">
        - Data Source Naming
            - We highly recommend having the Data Source name explain the underlying table / data it's referenceing
                - e.g. if you were to provision your own copy of our [DEMO] Orders OBT table, we'd recommend naming it `Orders OBT`, `Orders`, `[MyBrand] Orders OBT` etc
        - Field Naming & Field Descriptions
            - When creating a new data source from BigQuery, you'll notice computer-friendly field names containing words separated by underscores.  These are the field names as they exist in your warehouse (you can look up field definitions using this field name in our Metric & Dimension documentation)
            - We encourage you to rename fields in whatever format is easiest for your team to understand!
                - If you do decide to rename fields, we very strongly encourage you to copy the original field name into the Description field, as is this is the only reference you'll have to the original field name (in case of needing to look up definitions etc.)
            - For calculated fields, we recommend including the definition in the Description field
                - Data Source Viewers don't have access to examine underlying logic for calculated fields, so it's good for all-team visibility to have that logic defined in the field Description.
            - If you've made personal duplicates of one of SourceMedium's template data sources, you'll notice that we've already renamed fields and mapped their warehouse name in the Description field
                - Please do not edit the Description field on these data sources

                Outside of **date-range filtering**, there are two primary tools for filtering data in reports: **controls**, and **object-level filters**.  All 3 of these concepts can be combined in various ways to create perfectly manicured and highly functional reports.
                <AccordionGroup>
                    <Accordion title="Control components - page-level components that allow report viewers to filter data themselves">
                        
                        There are many different types of control components, which you can explore [here](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6312144?hl=en#types-of-controls) ranging from dropdown lists to user-input boxes.  By default, controls will attempt to filter all components on the page they exist on — however, you can group charts & filters together to create more manicured filtering scenarios.
                        
                        Controls are used when you want report users to have the ability to filter views themselves.

                        Object-level filters are useful when you want all users to have the same filter selection, without the ability to remove/change the filter selection.  Report viewers will not have the ability to see, edit, or remove these filters.

## Calculated fields — custom metrics & dimensions

Calculated fields allow you to use custom logic to create new metrics & dimensions based on your data without needing to drop into your data warehouse.

You can either create calculated fields directly within a report component (chart, table, filter) — for temporary or more isolated use — or you can create calculated fields at the data source level for all users to use.
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Creating calculated fields within a report component">
        1. Select the chart or control component you'd like to add your new field to
        2. Select Add Metric or Add Dimension, depending on the new field you'd like to create
            ![Screenshot 2024-03-04 at 11.54.31 AM.png](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_11.54.31_AM.png)

            - You can also select an already existing field and choose Add Field to replace an already existing metric/dimension
        3. An in-page window will open where you can name your new field and enter your custom logic
            ![Screenshot 2024-03-04 at 11.57.43 AM.png](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_11.57.43_AM.png)
                
        4. Once you're satisfied with your new formula, press Apply

        5. And you're done! You can now see your new field within the chart configuration panel, and rendered on your chart

        4. And you're done! You can now see your new field within the data source, and it can be used within any report that your data source has been added to. Be sure to update the Description for the new field, so that data source Viewers have visibility.

## Sharing access with your team
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Report access">
        Looker Studio Reports have 3 levels of available access
        - **Viewer** — can simply view the report
        - **Editor** — can view, and edit the report, and add access for other team mates
        - **Owner** — can view, edit, and delete the report, and add access for other team mates
        
        [Learn how to share a report](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6287179?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Data Source access">
        In the same way that you might want to have Viewers and Editors separately for reports, we recommend setting up a similar access structure for data sources.  

        - **Viewer** — this user can look at the data source and all of the field descriptions
        - **Editor** — this user can additionally rename fields & descriptions, edit the data source connection, and can create / edit / delete calculated fields.  This user can also add view and edit access for other users
        - **Owner** — this user can additionally delete the data source, and provision access to any user type (including changing ownership of the data source to a different user)

        [Learn how to share a data source](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/10403278?hl=en)

        **Note**: providing data source access to users is different than setting the [data credentials](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6371135?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article%2Cservice-account-credentials) for a data source
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Leveraging Google Groups for permission management">
        To make managing access for larger teams easier, we recommend setting up Google Groups for your different user types.  You can add members to these groups separately based on the access they should have to certain resources.  
        
        <Accordion title="For example, here's one group structure that we've seen work for teams">
            - **Admin** — this group has access to all resources
            - **Data source edit** — this group has access to edit data sources. These users should have access to your Managed Warehouse.
            - **Data source view** — this group has access to view data source details.  We recommend adding at least all report editors to this group
            - **Report edit** — has access to edit reports. We recommend not having too many “cooks in the kitchen” here
            - **Report view** — has access to view & use reports.
        </Accordion>
