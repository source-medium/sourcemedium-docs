Google provides a very useful high-level overview and quick-start guide for Looker Studio [HERE](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/9171315?hl=en#zippy=).  We recommend familiarizing yourself with this doc, if you have time.

If you're more of a visual learner, this 20 minute crash course will get you up and running 

However, we know people are busy, so below we've aggregated what we feel is the most important information you need to get from 0 → 60 with SourceMedium in Looker Studio.

<Accordion title="Glossary">

- A Looker Studio asset that contains a collection of **components** whose purpose is to present to viewers information and insights derived from your data.

[Connector / Data Source](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6268208?ref_topic=6370331&sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

- **Connectors** connect Looker Studio to your underlying data. Connecting to your data creates a *data source* in Looker Studio.
- **Data sources** represent a particular instance of a connector: for example, a connection to a specific BigQuery table or query, a Google Analytics property, or a Google Sheet. Data sources let you configure the fields and options provided by the connector used to create that connection instance. In addition, the data source gives you a secure way to share information and insights with report viewers who may not be able to directly access the underlying data.

[Components](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6291062?ref_topic=12141289&sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

- A widget that you add to a report to display your data, such as **charts**, **tables**, and interactive **date range controls** and **filter controls**. Data components get their information from a **data source**.
- You can also annotate your report with **text**, **shape**, **image**, and [embedded content](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/9132022) components.

[Field](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/7625527?sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

- A column of data.  Looker Studio uses two basic types of fields:
    - **Dimensions** are things that you want to measure, or that serve as ways to categorize your data.
    - **Metrics** are numbers that measure the things that are contained in dimensions.

**View Mode / Edit Mode**

- **Edit mode** allows you to edit the structure of a report and change, add, or remove data sources, and to use interactive controls.
    - People who can edit a report or data source are referred to as **editors**.
- **View mode** lets you see all the data that you are authorized to see, and to use interactive controls. View mode does not allow you to modify the report structure.
    - People who can only view a report or data source are referred to as **viewers**.

[Credentials](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6371135)

- The mechanism by which a data source determines who can see the data it provides.

        </Accordion>

        The steps for configuring your new data source will be the same, regardless of where you initiate the creation process.  The majority of your data source creation needs will be enabled via data coming from your BigQuery warehouse — using the Looker Studio BigQuery connection.  
        
        You can provision data sources directly based on tables in your BQ (create a new data source out of an entire table like `obt_orders`), or write your own queries to derive new tables based on tables within your warehouse.  We'll cover both methods below:

        **Prerequisite**: you must be logged into a Google account that has access to the underlying data you wish to work with within BigQuery

        1. Both methods start with you selecting the BigQuery connector

            </Accordion>
        2. Select data
            <Accordion title="Existing table from BQ">
                1. Under My Projects, select your SM managed warehouse (or other warehouse, no limits).  
                2. Then select a corresponding Dataset and Table.  
                3. Finally, press Add to create the data source
                4. For additional information on the Datasets & Tables available from SM and their utilities, visit here.

        3. Rename your new data source, add access for team members, and start getting your hands dirty!

        **Important Note**: Data sources access underlying data from your warehouse using Data Credentials — essentially, users of the data source will have access to all data the Data Credentials account has access to
            - By default, the account used to create the data source will automatically be assigned as the Data Credentials for that source
            - You can change the Data Credentials for a data source at any time
                - We recommend creating a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) to use as the Data Credential for all of your brand's managed data sources

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Data source hygiene & best practices">
        - Data Source Naming
            - We highly recommend having the Data Source name explain the underlying table / data it's referenceing
                - e.g. if you were to provision your own copy of our [DEMO] Orders OBT table, we'd recommend naming it `Orders OBT`, `Orders`, `[MyBrand] Orders OBT` etc
        - Field Naming & Field Descriptions
            - When creating a new data source from BigQuery, you'll notice computer-friendly field names containing words separated by underscores.  These are the field names as they exist in your warehouse (you can look up field definitions using this field name in our Metric & Dimension documentation)
            - We encourage you to rename fields in whatever format is easiest for your team to understand!
                - If you do decide to rename fields, we very strongly encourage you to copy the original field name into the Description field, as is this is the only reference you'll have to the original field name (in case of needing to look up definitions etc.)
            - For calculated fields, we recommend including the definition in the Description field
                - Data Source Viewers don't have access to examine underlying logic for calculated fields, so it's good for all-team visibility to have that logic defined in the field Description.
            - If you've made personal duplicates of one of SourceMedium's template data sources, you'll notice that we've already renamed fields and mapped their warehouse name in the Description field
                - Please do not edit the Description field on these data sources

By default, controls will attempt to filter all components on the page they exist on — however, you can group charts & filters together to create more manicured filtering scenarios.
                
                Controls are used when you want report users to have the ability to filter views themselves.

                Creating an object-level filter will create a reusable filter that can be used on multiple levels (charts, pages, & reports).

You can either create calculated fields directly within a report component (chart, table, filter) — for temporary or more isolated use — or you can create calculated fields at the data source level for all users to use.

## Sharing access with your team
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Report access">
        Looker Studio Reports have 3 levels of available access

        - Viewer — can simply view the report
        - Editor — can view, and edit the report, and add access for other team mates
        - Owner — can view, edit, and delete the report, and add access for other team mates
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Data Source access">
        In the same way that you might want to have Viewers and Editors separately for reports, we recommend setting up a similar access structure for data sources.  

        Note: providing data source access to users is different than setting the [data credentials](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6371135?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article%2Cservice-account-credentials) for a data source

        - Viewer — this user can look at the data source and all of the field descriptions
        - Editor — this user can additionally rename fields & descriptions, edit the data source connection, and can create / edit / delete calculated fields.  This user can also add view and edit access for other users
        - Owner — this user can additionally delete the data source, and provision access to any user type (including changing ownership of the data source to a different user)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Leveraging Google Groups for permission management">
        To make managing access for larger teams easier, we recommend setting up Google Groups for your different user types.  You can add members to these groups separately based on the access they should have to certain resources.  For example, here's one group structure that we've seen work for teams

        - Admin — this group has access to all resources
        - Data source edit — this group has access to edit data sources. These users should have access to your Managed Warehouse.
        - Data source view — this group has access to view data source details.  We recommend adding at least all report editors to this group
        - Report edit — has access to edit reports. We recommend not having too many “cooks in the kitchen” here
        - Report view — has access to view & use reports.

        You can find documentation on creating google groups [here](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2464926?hl=en).
