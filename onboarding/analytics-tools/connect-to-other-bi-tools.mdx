## TL;DR

- SourceMedium data lives in **BigQuery**, so you can use it in **any BI tool that can connect to BigQuery**.
- You’ll typically select your **Google Cloud project** → dataset (commonly `sm_transformed_v2`) → table/view (or use a **custom SQL query**).
- Make sure the user or service account you connect with has the right **BigQuery permissions** for the project/dataset.

## Notes for SourceMedium customers

- For Looker Studio specifically, see [Connect BigQuery to Looker Studio](/onboarding/analytics-tools/connect-bigquery-to-looker-studio).
- If you’re building dashboards for a team, prefer connecting with a **service account** (or a shared/managed identity) so access doesn’t break when an employee leaves.
