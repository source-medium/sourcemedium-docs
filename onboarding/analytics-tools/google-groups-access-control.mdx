## Why Google Groups?

Google Groups acts as an **identity primitive** across Google's ecosystem. One group email grants access to:

- **Looker Studio dashboards** (viewer or editor)
- **BigQuery datasets** (query access)
- **Google Sheets** (config sheets, exports)

<Info>
**One group email = unified access control.** Add a teammate to the group once, and they automatically get access to all shared resources.
</Info>

## Sharing Resources with Your Group

Once your group exists, use the group email to grant access across Google products.

### Looker Studio Dashboards

1. Open your dashboard and click **Share** (top right)
2. Enter the group email address
3. Choose permission level:
   - **Viewer**: Can view and interact with filters
   - **Editor**: Can modify the dashboard

![Share dashboard](/images/article-imgs/how-do-i-invite-users-to-my-dashboard/Untitled.png)

<Warning>
**Recommendation**: Grant **Viewer** access to most users. Editor access can lead to accidental changes that break dashboards.
</Warning>

### Google Sheets (Config Sheets)

1. Open the sheet and click **Share**
2. Enter the group email
3. Choose permission level:
   - **Viewer**: Read-only
   - **Commenter**: Can add comments
   - **Editor**: Can modify content

![Share sheet](/images/article-imgs/creating-google-groups/Untitled2.png)

### BigQuery Datasets

For BigQuery access, your SourceMedium team will configure IAM permissions using your group email. Contact support if you need to grant BigQuery access to additional team members.

---

## Recommended Group Structure

For most teams, we recommend two groups:

| Group | Purpose | Typical Access |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `company-sm-viewers` | Day-to-day dashboard users | Dashboard: Viewer, Sheets: Viewer |
| `company-sm-admins` | Analytics leads, data team | Dashboard: Editor, Sheets: Editor, BigQuery: Query |

<Tip>
Start with one group for simplicity. Split into viewer/admin groups when you have 5+ users with different needs.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "You don't have access" error

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check group membership">
    Verify the user is actually in the group at [groups.google.com](https://groups.google.com).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wait for propagation">
    Permission changes can take time to propagate across Google services. If you just added someone to the group or shared a resource, have the user sign out and back in, then try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check the correct email">
    Ensure the resource was shared with the **group email** (e.g., `team@googlegroups.com`), not an individual.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="External domain restrictions">
    If adding external users, ensure "Allow members outside your organization" is enabled in Group Settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Dashboard shows "No data"

This usually means the **data source** permissions are separate from dashboard permissions. Contact SourceMedium support to verify data source access.
