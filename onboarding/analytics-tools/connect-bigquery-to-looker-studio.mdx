## TL;DR

- You can connect **any** BigQuery table or view (including `sm_transformed_v2` tables) to Looker Studio using the **BigQuery connector**.
- If you start from a SourceMedium Looker Studio template, it’s usually **already connected** to your BigQuery project—adding more data is just adding another **data source**.
- If you don’t see data, it’s almost always a **permissions** or **credentials mode** issue.

## Connect a BigQuery table (fast)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your report in Edit mode">
    In Looker Studio, open your report and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a BigQuery data source">
    Go to **Resource → Manage added data sources → Add a data source**, then choose **BigQuery**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick the table (or use Custom Query)">
    Select your Google Cloud project, dataset (commonly `sm_transformed_v2`), and the table you want (for example, `obt_orders`), then click **Add**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you’re new to Looker Studio data sources, the [Looker Studio Guide](/onboarding/analytics-tools/looker-studio-guide) explains connectors, data sources, and credential modes.

## Add more tables to an existing SourceMedium template

When you copy a SourceMedium template, the existing charts are already wired to existing data sources. To use additional tables:

- Create a **new data source** pointing at the table/view you want in BigQuery
- Update a chart to use it: select the chart → **Data** panel → **Data source** → choose your new data source

## Common gotchas

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can’t find my project or dataset">
    Make sure you’re signed into the **same Google account** that has access to your BigQuery project, and that you have permission to view datasets and tables.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Viewers see 'No data'">
    Check the data source credential mode (Owner vs Viewer). SourceMedium dashboards typically work best with **Owner’s credentials** so viewers don’t need direct BigQuery access.
