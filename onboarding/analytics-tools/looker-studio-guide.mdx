## Glossary

Understanding these key terms will help you navigate Looker Studio effectively.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Report">
    A Looker Studio asset that contains a collection of **components** (charts, tables, controls) to present insights from your data.

    [Additional Documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6309867?sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connector / Data Source">
    **Connectors** connect Looker Studio to your underlying data. Connecting creates a **data source** in Looker Studio.

    **Data sources** represent a particular instance of a connector—for example, a connection to a specific BigQuery table, a Google Analytics property, or a Google Sheet. Data sources let you configure fields and options, and provide a secure way to share insights with viewers who may not have direct access to the underlying data.

    [Additional Documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6268208?ref_topic=6370331&sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Component">
    A widget you add to a report to display data: **charts**, **tables**, **date range controls**, **filter controls**, etc. Data components get their information from a **data source**.

    You can also add **text**, **shapes**, **images**, and [embedded content](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/9132022).

    [Additional Documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6291062?ref_topic=12141289&sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Field">
    A column of data. Looker Studio uses two basic types:
    - **Dimensions** — Categories or attributes you want to group by (e.g., `sm_channel`, `product_title`)
    - **Metrics** — Numbers that measure things (e.g., `order_net_revenue`, `orders`)

    [Additional Documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/7625527?sjid=14391589404630611402-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credentials">
    The mechanism determining who can see data in a data source. See [Credential Modes](#credential-modes-explained) below.

    [Additional Documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6371135)
  </Accordion>

## View vs Edit Mode

### View Mode (Default)
- Interact with filters and controls
- Hover over charts for details
- Cannot modify dashboard structure

### Edit Mode
- Modify charts, add new visualizations
- Change data sources and calculations
- **Requires Editor permission**

<Warning>
**Be careful in Edit mode.** Changes affect everyone who views the dashboard. If you want to experiment, make a copy first: **File → Make a copy**.
</Warning>

---

## Credential Modes Explained

Looker Studio dashboards can use two different credential modes for data access. Understanding this helps troubleshoot "no data" issues.

### Owner's Credentials (Recommended)

- **How it works**: Dashboard uses the owner's BigQuery permissions
- **Viewers see**: Data without needing their own BigQuery access
- **Best for**: Sharing dashboards broadly within your organization

### Viewer's Credentials

- **How it works**: Each viewer must have their own BigQuery access
- **Viewers see**: Only data they have permission to access
- **Best for**: Dashboards with sensitive data requiring row-level security

<Info>
SourceMedium dashboards typically use **Owner's Credentials** so your team can view data without individual BigQuery access.
</Info>

## SourceMedium Templates

If you're on our [Managed Data Warehouse](/data-activation/managed-data-warehouse/overview) solution, SourceMedium provides template reports and data sources:

- [Looker Studio Template Copy Instructions](/data-activation/template-resources/looker-studio-template-copy-instructions)
- [Data Source Template Directory](/data-activation/template-resources/sm-looker-data-source-template-directory)
- [Report Template Directory](/data-activation/template-resources/sm-looker-report-template-directory)

---

## Creating & Managing Data Sources

Data sources connect your reports to data stored in BigQuery, Google Sheets, Google Analytics, etc.

### Creating a New Data Source

**Prerequisite**: You must be logged into a Google account with BigQuery access.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Create from your report (Edit mode)">
    ![Create data source from report](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_9.07.22_AM.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2: Create from Looker Studio home page">
    ![Create data source from home](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_9.05.39_AM.png)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the BigQuery connector">
    ![Select BigQuery connector](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_9.09.15_AM.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your data">
    **From an existing table:**
    1. Under My Projects, select your SourceMedium warehouse
    2. Select a Dataset (e.g., `sm_transformed_v2`) and Table (e.g., `obt_orders`)
    3. Click **Add**

    ![Select BigQuery table](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_9.11.30_AM.png)

    **From a custom query:**
    1. Select **Custom Query** from the left menu
    2. Select your project
    3. Write your SQL query
    4. Click **Add**

    ![Custom SQL query](/images/article-imgs/learn-looker-studio/Screenshot_2024-03-04_at_9.18.39_AM.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure and share">
    Rename your data source descriptively (e.g., "Orders OBT", "[MyBrand] Orders") and configure access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Data Source Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Naming conventions">
    Name data sources to clearly indicate the underlying table:
    - ✅ `Orders OBT`, `[MyBrand] Orders`, `Ad Performance Daily`
    - ❌ `Data Source 1`, `Copy of Copy of Orders`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Field naming and descriptions">
    BigQuery fields use `snake_case` (e.g., `order_net_revenue`). You can rename fields for readability, but:

    - **Copy the original field name into the Description field** — this is your only reference for looking up definitions
    - For calculated fields, include the formula in the Description
    - Don't edit Descriptions on SourceMedium template data sources
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Service account credentials">
    For production data sources, use a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) as the Data Credential:

    - Ensures access survives when employees leave
    - Centralizes permission management
    - See [service account setup for Looker Studio](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/10835295?sjid=1005066725261683010-NC#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

## Filtering Data

### Filter Controls (Interactive)
Filter controls let **report viewers** filter data themselves using dropdowns, input boxes, etc.

- By default, controls filter all components on the page
- You can group charts with filters for more targeted filtering
- [Control types documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6312144?hl=en#types-of-controls)

### Object-Level Filters (Fixed)
Object-level filters are **pre-set by editors** and cannot be changed by viewers. They apply at the chart, page, or report level.

- Use when all users should see the same filtered view
- Viewers cannot see, edit, or remove these filters
- [Create and manage filters](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/7326859?hl=en)

## Sharing Your Dashboard

### Permission Levels

| Level | View | Interact | Edit | Share | Delete |
|-------|------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Viewer | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Owner | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Sharing a Report

1. Click **Share** (top right)
2. Enter email addresses or Google Group emails
3. Choose permission level

![Share dialog](/images/article-imgs/how-do-i-invite-users-to-my-dashboard/Untitled.png)

### Sharing a Data Source

Data source access is **separate** from report access:

- **Viewer**: Can see field names and descriptions
- **Editor**: Can rename fields, edit calculated fields, change the connection
- **Owner**: Can delete the data source, change ownership

[Learn how to share a data source](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/10403278?hl=en)

<Note>
Data source access ≠ data credentials. Access controls who can modify the data source configuration; credentials control who can see the underlying data.
</Note>

### Using Google Groups

For teams with 5+ users, manage access via [Google Groups](/onboarding/analytics-tools/google-groups-access-control):

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `company-sm-admins` | Full access to reports and data sources |
| `company-sm-editors` | Report editors, data source viewers |
| `company-sm-viewers` | Report viewers only |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard shows 'No data'">
    **Check these in order:**
    1. Date range filter — is it set to a period with data?
    2. Other filters — are they excluding all data?
    3. Data source credentials — do they have BigQuery access?
    4. Contact SourceMedium support if issues persist
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Charts are slow to load">
    Large date ranges or complex calculations slow performance. Try:
    - Reducing the date range
    - Using pre-aggregated metrics when available
    - Removing unnecessary charts from the page
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't enter Edit mode">
    You need **Editor** permission. Contact the dashboard owner or admin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes aren't saving">
    - Ensure you have Editor permission
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try refreshing and re-entering Edit mode
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Filter not affecting all charts">
    In Edit mode:
    1. Click the filter control
    2. Check **Properties** → **Filter applied to**
    3. Ensure relevant charts are selected
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'You don't have access' on data source">
    - Verify you have data source Viewer or Editor access
    - Check the data credentials match your BigQuery permissions
    - Permission changes can take time to propagate—sign out and back in
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
