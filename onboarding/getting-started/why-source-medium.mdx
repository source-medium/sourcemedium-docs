## Why SourceMedium

✅ **We're obsessed with the quality of your data**

Troublesome Google Analytics and UTM tracking? Are you properly segmenting your spend among sales channels and international markets? How about excluding $0 revenue orders like influencer samples? 

We won't rest until your numbers and metrics are accurate and reliable.

✅ **We automate your manual work** 

Spending countless hours with error-prone manual data pulls, pivot tables and visualizations? We've been there. Our customers save up to 20+ hours per week by replacing unreliable data management tools and processes.

✅ **We prioritize accurate last-click attribution**

SourceMedium uses multiple attribution signals (including UTMs and other touchpoints) and a clear source selection hierarchy to maximize coverage and consistency.

 ✅ **We're built for omni-channel businesses**

Our rapidly expanding list of integrations include curated eCommerce, marketing, and operations channels that are interconnected so you can leverage your data for more advanced, cross-channel insights. 

Retail and offline coverage varies by customer and setup — ask your SourceMedium team if you need retail support.

🧊 **Will help uncover deep insights on your business**

Our dashboards are flexible, and like an iceberg will uncover more of our deep data layer as new use cases emerge. We **intelligently aggregate multiple first-party data sources** to analyze customers, orders, and products at a more granular level so you can run meaningful analysis vs. just high level reporting.
