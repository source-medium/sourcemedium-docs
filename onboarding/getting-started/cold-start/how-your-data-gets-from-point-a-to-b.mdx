Our **data model** integrates and cleans your platforms’ data into a master table that each module of the 
dashboard interacts with differently depending on the purpose of the module.

We use data from your sales platform (Shopify, Amazon, etc) as the “source of truth” for all sales-based reporting.

    Default **data cleaning** includes separating your sales into different channels. The Channel 
    filter on each module is defaulted to **Online DTC** (excluding Exchanged, Draft, and Wholesale 
    orders to avoid skewing composite metrics such as Average Order Value).
