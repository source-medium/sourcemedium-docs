__Hi, we're SourceMedium and we're excited to work with you!__

In this document, you'll find the steps and resources to get you started with SourceMedium.

<Steps titleSize="h2">

  <Step title="Learn About SourceMedium">
    If you haven't done so already, checkout [What Is SourceMedium](/help-center/what-is-sourcemedium) and read through 
    some of the finer details around how we [transform](/data-transformations/philosophy) and help 
    [activate](/data-activation/managed-data-warehouse/overview) your data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate Your Data">

    <Note>
    __Your onboarding and implementation team will share a unique link to our data integrations app, which you can use to grant us access to your data sources__.
    </Note>

    Included below is a prioritized list of data sources you'll want to integrate to get you up and running as quickly as 
    possible.

    While we've automated the connection process for many of these data sources __(please see note about our integrations app above)__, our 
    [Data Integrations & Inputs](/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/all-available-integrations) section has instructions for 
    how to connect any data source within our marketplace of supported connectors.

  <Step title="Schedule Your Analytical Deep Dive">
    -  As part of your onboarding and implementation process, we'll conduct a 1-hour deep dive review of the data you've integrated with SourceMedium, 
    in which a member of the SourceMedium team will walk through your data live and start to uncover some of the key 
    questions and insights for your business
    - To give you a sense of timing, we will start populating your data within 72 hours after permissions are granted to the data sources you'd like to integrate
    - Your team will be notified by Slack or by email when your data is ready to be viewed 

    <Info>If you're an enterprise customer, we'll schedule a 1-hour requirements gathering session in lieu of this deep dive</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Asking Questions">
    - You have access to our Customer Solutions Analysts (CSAs) who are deeply knowledgeable in our product and e-commerce metrics, and can help answer questions related to:
        - Report functionality
        - Data accuracy
        - Customizations (after implementation period)
        - Analytical insights
  </Step>

  <Step title="What Happens Next?">
    - If you decide to continue using SourceMedium after your initial implementation period, you've made the right decision
    - If you decide not to continue using SourceMedium after your initial implementation period, SourceMedium will stop ingesting your 
    data and will delete any integrations you've setup
  </Step>

  <Step title="Communicating with the SourceMedium team">
    During your onboarding and implementation period, your team will have access to a shared Slack group with the SourceMedium team for 
    direct communication. If you do not currently have access and would like to set up this shared group, please email support@sourcemedium.com .
