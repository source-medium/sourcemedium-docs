            Looker Studio View permissions allow users to look, but not touch. They will be able to see all analytics present 
            on your dashboard, but they won't be able to edit charts or view any underlying data, though they can still operate filters. 
            This is the safest permission to grant, suitable for anyone who can be trusted to look at your data. 

            __How to Set this Permission:__ <br/>
            Set this permission on your Source Medium Dashboard, which is always accessed from the link provided during your onboarding and 
            pinned to your shared slack channel, should you choose to have one, otherwise provided by email. Use the Share button at the top right

            Looker Studio data source editing permissions allow users to view, edit the connection of, and create custom data source level metrics in data sources
            associated with Looker Studio dashboards. 

            __How to Set this Permission:__ <br/>
            This permission is set in multiple places. First, it is set on each data source in Looker Studio at the top of the edit screen with the heading 
            "Data credentials." For embedded data sources, the "Owner's Credentials" option from this menu will allow anyone with edit access to the report 
            to edit the data source. For reusable data sources, and when the data credentials are set to "Viewer's Credentials," the user must have edit access
            to the data source on its original platform, e.g Big Query, Google Analytics, in order to edit the data source.
