One of the biggest times of year for our customers is BFCM. Here are some of the most common questions our customers ask during that period. **Do you know the answers?**
1. Am I acquiring new customers profitably today? How does their profitability potential compare vs. non-sale periods?
2. What were the top performing acquisition channels for new customers? For repeat customers (were they low cost-channels)?
3. Did my marketing mix optimize my contribution margin potential (e.g. the gross profit on all orders - marketing costs)?
4. Was I able to scale my spend (vs. baseline) profitably?
5. Did I incentivize the right type of purchasers during the sale period? (e.g. first timers, subscribers, higher AOV)
6. How did I perform across my sales channels (DTC, Amazon)?

### Here are some additional helpful video tips as you prepare for your BFCM season.
