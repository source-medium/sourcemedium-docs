## Metric Types

- **Simple**: Direct aggregation of a measure (e.g., SUM of revenue)
- **Ratio**: Division of two metrics (e.g., revenue / orders = AOV)
- **Derived**: Calculation involving other metrics with custom expressions
- **Cumulative**: Running total over a time period (e.g., MTD revenue)

## Discovering More Metrics

The semantic layer includes 180+ metrics across all categories. To explore the complete list:

```sql
-- List all metrics by category
SELECT
    metric_category,
    metric_name,
    metric_label,
    metric_type
FROM `your_project.sm_metadata.dim_semantic_metric_catalog`
ORDER BY metric_category, metric_name
```

```sql
-- Find metrics matching a keyword
SELECT
    metric_name,
    metric_description,
    calculation
FROM `your_project.sm_metadata.dim_semantic_metric_catalog`
WHERE LOWER(metric_name) LIKE '%revenue%'
   OR LOWER(metric_description) LIKE '%revenue%'
```

See the [dim_semantic_metric_catalog documentation](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_metadata/dim_semantic_metric_catalog) for more query examples and detailed schema information.
