The **Executive Summary** table (`rpt_executive_summary_daily`) provides daily aggregated KPIs across channels for executive reporting and dashboards.

<Note>
**Table Grain:** One row per `(sm_store_id, sm_channel, sm_sub_channel, date)`.

This means queries without filtering or grouping by channel will return multiple rows per date. Always aggregate or filter by channel for single daily values.
