Good data hygiene makes reporting more trustworthy and reduces time spent reconciling differences across tools.

## What “good hygiene” means

- Consistent naming conventions for channels, campaigns, and UTMs
- Stable identifiers (customer, order, product) across systems
- Clear definitions for metrics (gross vs net, refunds, cancellations)

## Common causes of reporting issues

- Missing or inconsistent UTMs (especially for email/SMS and subscriptions)
- Timezone mismatches across platforms
- Changes to orders after purchase (edits, refunds, cancellations)

## What to do next

- Standardize UTMs: [Improving Your Last-Click (UTM) Attribution](/data-inputs/platform-supporting-resources/ga4/improving-last-click-attribution)
