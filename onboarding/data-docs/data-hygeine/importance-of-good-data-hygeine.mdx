Good data hygiene makes reporting more trustworthy and reduces time spent reconciling differences across tools.

## What “good hygiene” means

- Consistent naming conventions for channels, campaigns, and UTMs
- Stable identifiers (customer, order, product) across systems
- Clear definitions for metrics (gross vs net, refunds, cancellations)

## Common causes of reporting issues

- Missing or inconsistent UTMs (especially for email/SMS and subscriptions)
- Timezone mismatches across platforms
- Changes to orders after purchase (edits, refunds, cancellations)

## What to do next

- Standardize UTMs: [UTM Setup](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/utm-setup)
- Learn why sources differ: [Why would external reports not match the SourceMedium dashboard?](/help-center/faq/data-faqs/why-would-external-reports-not-match-the-sourcemedium-dashboard)
