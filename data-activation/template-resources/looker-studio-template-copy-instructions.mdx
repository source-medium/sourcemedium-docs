Below, we outline how you can seamlessly leverage our Looker Studio data source and report templates for our `obt_orders`
dataset.

### Step 1: Create your data sources
<Info>
Please note that you'll need to replicate this process for any other data sources you wish to use. See the full list of 
data source templates [here](/data-activation/template-resources/sm-data-source-template-directory).
</Info>
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Copy data source template">
        1. Click to open the [Demo] Orders OBT data source
        2. Near the top-right of the page, directly to the left of the "CREATE REPORT" button, you’ll see a small icon showing a rectangle 
        imposed over another rectangle
            - Click this icon to create a duplicate of the data source
            ![navigate-copy-data-source.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/navigate-copy-data-source.png)
            - When prompted to confirm that you’d like to create a copy, select `Copy Data Source`
            ![copy-data-source.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/copy-data-source.png)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Reconfigure the data source copy">
        1. Navigate to your newly duplicated data source in the new tab that was opened
        2. Rename the data source, and update the query powering the data source with the name of your data warehouse
            - Replace `sm-democo` with the name of your warehouse (e.g. `mybrand-warehouse`), leaving the `.sm_transformed_v2.obt_orders` portion unchanged
            - For data source naming, we recommend to always explicitly reference the underlying data that’s present
                - For example, we've named this data source `[MyBrand] Orders`, as it uses data from the `obt_orders` table, but 
                other potential names could be `[SM] Orders` or simply `Orders`
                ![reconfig-data-source.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/reconfig-data-source.png)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Connect the data source to your Managed Data Warehouse">
        1. Once you've reconfigured your data source copy, click "RECONNECT"
        ![connect-reconfiged-data-source.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/connect-reconfiged-data-source.png)
        2. When prompted to confirm any “connection changes” before moving on, press "Continue" (if you do see changes listed here,
        simply press "Apply" as this ensure you're receiving the most up-to-date version of this data source)
        ![connection-changes-not-found.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/connection-changes-not-found.png)
        ![connection-changes.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/connection-changes.png)
        3. After clicking "Continue", you'll land on the data source explorer screen.
        Congrats! You've successfully created your own copy of a data source!

### Step 2: Create your dashboard
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Open SourceMedium's base template dashboard">
        1. Ensure you’re logged into the same Google account you used while duplicating data sources in __Step 1__
        2. Open the SourceMedium Looker Studio [base template dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/655de73a-1df6-432e-b62b-3a99b9779f1a/page/p_yco5gdehad)
        3. Hover near the top of the web page until the top navigation bar appears and click on the icon showing three 
        vertical dots ("More options") and select "Make a copy"
        ![make-dash-copy.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/make-dash-copy.png)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Map your copied data sources">
        1. A modal will open asking you to “Select the data source(s) to be added to the new report”
        2. For each “Original Data Source” on the left, select your corresponding newly created data source from __Step 1__
            - For example, for `[DEMO] Orders OBT` (left), we would select the `[MyBrand] Orders OBT` data source we made during __Step 1__ 
            in the corresponding slot on the right
            ![map-data-sources.png](/images/article-imgs/looker-studio-template-setup/map-data-sources.png)
        3. Once you’ve finished mapping all Original Data Sources to your newly created data sources, press "Copy Report"
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Rename your report and share access with your team">
        1. Rename your new report and share access with any users you’d like to have access to your new dashboard
            - We recommend setting up Google Groups for managing team access
            - You can find more information on setting up Google Groups and our best practices [here](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601?hl=en)
