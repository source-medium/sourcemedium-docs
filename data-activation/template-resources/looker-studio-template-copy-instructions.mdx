Below, we outline how you can easily leverage our Looker Studio report templates for our `obt_orders`
dataset.

### 1. Create your data sources
As part of your onboarding process, the SourceMedium team will create and grant you access to the Looker Studio data sources that our base 
BI template uses.


### 2. Create your dashboard
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Open SourceMedium's base template dashboard">
        1. Open the SourceMedium Looker Studio [base template dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/655de73a-1df6-432e-b62b-3a99b9779f1a/page/p_yco5gdehad)
        2. Hover near the top of the web page until the top navigation bar appears and click on the icon showing three 
        vertical dots ("More options") and select "Make a copy"

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Map your copied data sources">
        1. A modal will open asking you to “Select the data source(s) to be added to the new report”
        2. For each “Original Data Source” on the left, select the corresponding data source on the right
            - For example, for `[DEMO] Orders OBT` (left), we would select the `[MyBrand] Orders OBT` data source the SourceMedium team created

        3. Once you’ve finished mapping all original Data Sources, press "Copy Report"
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Rename your report and share access with your team">
        1. Rename your new report and share access with any users you’d like to have access to your new dashboard
            - We recommend setting up Google Groups for managing team access
            - You can find more information on setting up Google Groups and our best practices [here](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601?hl=en)
