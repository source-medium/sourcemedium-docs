Use this guide to copy SourceMedium-provided Looker Studio **data source templates** and connect them to your environment.

## When to use this

- You want to build new reports using the SourceMedium table layer without recreating fields from scratch.
- You want to start from an existing template and modify dimensions/metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Looker Studio
- Access to your SourceMedium datasets in BigQuery (or your managed warehouse, if applicable)

## Steps

1. Start with the template directory (if provided by your team).
2. Make a copy of the data source.
3. Map the copied data source to your account’s tables/datasets.
4. Validate field types (dates, numbers, booleans) before building charts.

If you’re copying full reports (dashboards), start with: [Copying SourceMedium report templates](/data-activation/template-resources/copying-sm-report-templates)
