## What Is A Managed Data Warehouse?

SourceMedium's Managed Data Warehouse offering helps simplify data warehouse adoption, a tablestakes 
technology investment for businesses looking to establish a competitive advantage through data and advanced analytics.

Once we've ingested data from the sources you've integrated, we run our [transformation pipeline](/data-transformations/philosophy) and deliver data into a 
managed data warehouse instance that you can access directly.

Through this product, you'll get:

__- Data quality:__ We've collaborated with hundreds of e-commerce merchants to refine our models and decision-making frameworks to ensure our data is 
accurate, reliable, and [intuitive](/data-transformations/philosophy#how-we-shape-our-data) no matter the analytical use case. 
We also conduct over 2,500 data quality tests daily to help enforce our quality standards.

__- Time to value & predictability:__ We streamling your data infrastructure stack so you don't have to manage a data pipeline, build models 
from the ground up, and navigate the unpredictability of billing, cost optimization, identity access management, security, performance, and more.

__- Future-proofing:__ As your data needs grow alongside your business, you'll already have the infrastructural versatility and scalability 
in place to 10x your capabilities.

## Activating Your Managed Data Warehouse

To kickstart your journey activating the data in your Managed Data Warehouse, we offer two primary pathways to get started.

### Bootstrap your BI with our base templates

While you can connect your Managed Data Warehouse to any BI tool, our base data source and report templates are a great 
starting point for businesses looking to quickly gain insights without the need to build charts and tables from scratch. 
These templates are designed around our pre-configured semantic layer ([see OBT table description](/data-transformations/philosophy#one-big-tables)), 
helping turbocharge BI developers and data analysts.

Learn how to leverage our base data source and report templates [here](/data-activation/managed-data-warehouse/bi-tools).

### Build models inside your warehouse

For businesses with custom analytics needs that our out-of-the-box semantic layer doesn't address, you can build customized models directly 
in your Managed Data Warehouse.
