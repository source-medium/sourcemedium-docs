This example 👆 demonstrates setting the date range filter to YTD, selecting multiple channels, setting a chart's date 
granularity to 'month', changing optional metrics, exporting chart data, and resetting filters. Here's some more info on each:

#### Report Documentation Key
Located in the top left of each module
<Frame type="glass">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/report-documentation-key.avif"/>
</Frame>


Key definitions and documentation pertaining to each module.

#### Date Range Filter
Located in the top right of each module and allows you to toggle between any dates since the start of your commerce and 
marketing platforms ingested data history
<Frame type="glass">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/date-range-filter.avif"/>
</Frame>

On most pages, this filter applies to every chart on that specific dashboard page and the default range is 28 days.

Updating a date filter on a specific dashboard page will not automatically change the date ranges of the other dashboard pages.

By default, the current day is not included and we suggest not to use the current day in your analysis as your dashboards are 
refreshed each day with the prior day 's data.

#### Row Up/Down Icons
The up and down arrows that can be found on many tables and charts help to change the grouping time frame of reference 
(day ↔  week ↔  month ↔  year) or hierarchy of data (Source/Medium ↔  Campaign ↔  Landing Page)

<Frame caption="Same chart after 'drilling up' using the small arrows (weekly granularity)">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/chart-on-weekly-granularity.avif"/>
</Frame>

<Tip>This can be especially useful when looking to 'zoom out' to identify high level trends within general areas of your business, 
and then 'drilling down' into specific areas of focus once these trends are identified.</Tip>

</Accordion>

#### Channel Filter
Located in the top right of each module and allows you to toggle between your various commerce and marketing channels 
<Frame type="glass">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/channel-filter.avif"/>
</Frame>

This defaults to Online DTC (where we have out-of-the-box data cleaning logic to separate Draft and Exchanged orders).

Otherwise, this is where your other channels (Amazon, Wholesale, Retail) live.

These can be selected independently or in combination to view different slices of your business.

#### Brand ID Selector
Located in the top right of each module
<Frame type="glass">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/brand-id-selector.avif"/>
</Frame>

If you have multiple online store instances integrated with SourceMedium the Brand ID selector will allow you to select different 
combinations at once.

#### Optional metrics
Available on selected charts
<Frame type="glass">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/optional-metrics-selector.avif"/>
</Frame>

Some charts allow you to change the metrics displayed. 

These choices can be customized with any metrics available in the module by reaching out to the SourceMedium team.

#### Resetting filters
Located in the toggle menu bar at the top of each module
<Frame type="glass">
    <img src="/images/article-imgs/core-dashboard-features/reset-current-filters.avif"/>
</Frame>

This button clears all filters currently selected in the module to their defaults — this is especially helpful when performing complex 
analyses in the deep dive modules that contain many filters.
