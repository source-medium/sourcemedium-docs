#### Potential Reporting Differences & Discrepancies
    - For Meta, SourceMedium reports on the attribution window set at the campaign level.  If you are looking at different attribution windows within the Meta UI it will look like there is a discrepancy in reporting vs. the SourceMedium dashboard.
    - SourceMedium separates **Campaign Types** based on common Campaign naming conventions, which can be modified if our logic does not pick up the correct categorization.
