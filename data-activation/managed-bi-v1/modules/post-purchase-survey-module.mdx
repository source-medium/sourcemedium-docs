The Post-Purchase Survey Module surfaces **zero-party attribution data**—self-reported responses from "How Did You Hear About Us?" (HDYHAU) surveys.

<Info>
Zero-party data complements tracking-based attribution by capturing channels that are hard to track: word of mouth, podcasts, influencers, and offline media.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

To use this module, you need:
1. A post-purchase survey tool (Fairing, KnoCommerce, or similar)
2. Order tagging enabled (survey responses tagged to orders)
3. Consistent tag format (e.g., `HDYHAU-Facebook`, `PPS-TikTok`)

See [Post-Purchase Survey Best Practices](/help-center/faq/account-management-faqs/best-practices-in-setting-up-a-post-purchase-hdyhau-survey) for setup guidance.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Response Rate** | Orders with survey response / Total orders |
| **Channel Distribution** | % of responses attributed to each channel |
| **Revenue by Channel** | Revenue from orders tagged with each survey response |
| **New Customer Distribution** | Survey responses from first-time buyers only |

## Module Sections

### Survey Response Distribution

Shows the breakdown of how customers say they discovered your brand:

- **Bar chart**: Response counts by channel
- **Pie chart**: Percentage distribution
- **Table**: Detailed breakdown with revenue

<Tip>
Compare survey attribution to your tracking-based attribution. Large gaps may indicate tracking blind spots or channels you're under-crediting.
</Tip>

### Response Rate Trends

Track survey completion over time:
- Are response rates consistent?
- Did a site change affect survey visibility?
- Seasonal patterns in discovery channels?

### Revenue Attribution

Connect survey responses to business outcomes:
- Which discovery channels drive the most revenue?
- What's the average order value by discovery channel?
- How does new customer LTV vary by discovery channel?

## Common Analyses

### 1. Tracking vs Survey Comparison

Compare what tracking says vs what customers say:

| Channel | Tracking Attribution | Survey Attribution | Gap |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Meta | 45% | 25% | +20% over-credited |
| Podcast | 0% | 12% | -12% under-credited |
| Word of Mouth | 0% | 18% | -18% invisible to tracking |

<Note>
Gaps don't mean either source is "wrong"—they measure different things. Tracking captures last-touch interactions; surveys capture initial discovery.
</Note>

### 2. New Customer Discovery

Filter to first-time buyers only to understand:
- Where are **new** customers coming from?
- Which channels drive **acquisition** vs re-engagement?

### 3. Channel Quality Analysis

Go beyond volume to measure channel quality:
- **AOV by channel**: Do podcast customers spend more?
- **Repeat rate by channel**: Do referral customers have higher retention?
- **LTV by channel**: Which discovery channels drive the best long-term customers?

## Interpreting Survey Data

### Expected Patterns

| Channel | Typical Survey % | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Social (Meta, TikTok, IG) | 20-40% | Often primary for DTC brands |
| Word of Mouth / Referral | 10-25% | Strong indicator of brand health |
| Search (Google) | 5-15% | Usually lower than tracking shows |
| Email | 3-8% | Rarely "first" discovery |
| Podcast / Influencer | 5-15% | Highly variable by brand |
| "I don't remember" | 10-20% | Expected; indicates honest responses |

### Red Flags

<Warning>
Watch for these data quality issues:

- **Control channel > 5%**: Customers may be clicking randomly
- **"I don't remember" < 5%**: Survey may be forcing responses
- **Response rate < 10%**: Survey placement may need adjustment
- **One channel > 60%**: Consider if options are too limited
</Warning>

## Filtering & Segmentation

Use these filters to slice survey data:

| Filter | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Date range** | Seasonal discovery patterns |
| **Customer type** | New vs returning customer discovery |
| **Order value** | High-value customer discovery |
| **Product** | Product-specific discovery channels |
| **Geography** | Regional marketing effectiveness |

## Combining with Other Data

### Zero-Party + First-Party Attribution

For the most complete picture:

1. **Survey data**: "How did you first hear about us?" (awareness)
2. **UTM/tracking data**: Last touchpoint before purchase (conversion)
3. **MTA data**: Multi-touch credit across the journey

<Tip>
Use survey data to inform your MTA model weights. If surveys show 15% podcast discovery but tracking shows 0%, consider adding podcast as a valid touchpoint.
