#### What is the New Customer Analysis module and what data can be found there?
    - This specifically formatted module that pulls your online store data (Shopify, Amazon, Stripe, Chargebee) as well as from the Configuration Sheet.
    - This module is entirely based on a customer's order_date as opposed to when a customer is first acquired known as their cohort_date (except in the case of the filters which are still applied to a customers acquisition order).
