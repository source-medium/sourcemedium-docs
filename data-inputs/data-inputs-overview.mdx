This section covers how SourceMedium ingests data from your sales, marketing, subscription, and analytics platforms, plus what you can provide via user inputs.

## What counts as an “integration”

Integrations fall into a few buckets:

- **Direct platform integrations** (Shopify, GA4, ad platforms, etc.)
- **Connectors / ingestion partners** (where applicable)
- **User inputs** via the SourceMedium Configuration Sheet (costs, targets, and non-integrated sales)

## Getting started

1. Start with the full list of supported integrations: [All available integrations](/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/all-available-integrations)
2. Connect your highest-impact sources first:
   - Ecommerce sales (Shopify / Amazon)
   - Paid media (Google Ads / Meta Ads / Amazon Ads)
   - Web analytics (GA4)
3. Standardize channels and fill gaps using the configuration sheet:
