## What is Attribution Health?

Attribution health measures how completely your marketing touchpoints are being captured and connected to customer purchases. High attribution rates mean you can confidently analyze which channels drive revenue; low rates mean you're flying blind.

<Info>
If you're seeing high rates of `(direct) / (none)` in your attribution data, this section will help you diagnose and fix the gaps.

  <Card title="Cross-Domain Issues" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Customers moving between domains (ads → landing page → checkout) can lose UTM parameters along the way.

  <Card title="Missing UTM Parameters" icon="link-slash">
    Marketing campaigns without proper UTM tagging result in traffic appearing as direct/none.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delayed Attribution" icon="clock">

## Choosing the Right Approach

| Method | Best For | Limitations |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Checkout Attributes** | High ad blocker rates, Shopify Plus stores | Doesn't work with accelerated checkout (Apple Pay, etc.) |
| **HDYHAU Surveys** | Understanding top-of-funnel discovery | Self-reported data can be inaccurate |
| **UTM Best Practices** | Prevention—catching gaps before they happen | Doesn't fix historical data |
| **Fairing/KnoCommerce** | Automated survey collection at scale | Requires additional integration |

<Tip>
**Recommended approach**: Implement UTM best practices as your foundation, add checkout attribute capture for server-side backup, and use HDYHAU surveys to validate and supplement your tracking-based data.
