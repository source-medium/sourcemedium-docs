### FAQ

- Do we really need to grant SourceMedium all these permissions?
    - Yes, the permissions are necessary for us to programmatically access all of the most important data. If we ever become aware of decreased permissions for certain roles, we will let you know ASAP. Rest assured, we take our data security very seriously at SourceMedium and your data will never be used for any purposes outside of reporting without your explicit consent.
