## Follow this integration guide to connect your Amazon Seller Central (Selling Partner) data to SourceMedium.

### Requirements

- **Admin access** to your Amazon Seller Central account
- Be able to add SourceMedium as a new user and adjust permissions
- Premium Integration

### FAQ

- Do we really need to grant SourceMedium all these permissions?
    - Since the SP-API is so new, the permissions are necessary for us to programmatically access all of the most important data. If we ever become aware of decreased permissions for certain roles, we will let you know ASAP. Rest assured, we take our data security very seriously at SourceMedium and your data will never be used for any purposes outside of reporting without your explicit consent.

### **Steps**

Add SourceMedium as a user in Seller Central

- Click `User Permissions` under `Settings`

- Click **Invite**. The email invitation is sent to the email address you specified.
- Once SourceMedium accepts the invitation, apply these permissions:
