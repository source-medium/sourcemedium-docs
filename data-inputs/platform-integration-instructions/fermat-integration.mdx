## Follow this integration guide to connect Fermat data to SourceMedium

FERMÀT is a Shopify app. SourceMedium detects Fermat-attributed orders via Shopify order metadata.

### Requirements

- A working [Shopify integration](/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/shopify-integration)
- Admin access to Shopify to confirm the Fermat app is installed and active

### Steps

1. Confirm Shopify is connected to SourceMedium.
2. Confirm the Fermat Shopify app is installed and being used for your storefront experience.
3. Email **[integrations@sourcemedium.com](mailto:integrations@sourcemedium.com)** to confirm your store uses FERMÀT so we can validate detection and reporting.

### Troubleshooting

- If Fermat orders appear in Shopify but are not showing as expected in SourceMedium, contact **[integrations@sourcemedium.com](mailto:integrations@sourcemedium.com)** and include:
  - Your Shopify store name
  - Example order IDs and order processed dates
