### Additional information

Common troubleshooting steps in case your API key does not correctly load

- If the "API tokens..." link is not present
    - The API tokens must be enabled manually by ReCharge. Learn how to enable the keys in ReCharge’s [**documentation**](https://support.rechargepayments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008829993)
- If you've reached ReCharge’s hard limit on the number of API tokens
    - Share one of your existing API keys with similar permission scopes
