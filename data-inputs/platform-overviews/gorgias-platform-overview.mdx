## Overview

The Customer Support data models provide analytics-ready transformations of your [Gorgias](https://www.gorgias.com/) customer support platform data in BigQuery. These models enable you to track, analyze, and visualize your customer support performance through our [pre-built dashboard template](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/iEvv2YdLPiM) or custom analysis via SQL.

The integration transforms your raw Gorgias data into a structured, optimized format that follows SourceMedium's unified data model approach, ensuring consistent metrics definitions across all customer support platforms.

### Why This Integration Matters

Until now, your customer support data likely existed in isolation. This integration solves that problem by:

- **Connecting siloed data systems**: Transform support data into actionable insights in your analytics environment
- **Reducing data wrangling**: 60%+ reduction in data preparation time for your technical teams
- **Providing immediate value**: Pre-built, open-source dashboard template ready for immediate visualization
- **Enabling customer segmentation**: Join support data with Shopify customer data to understand how different segments experience your support

## Data Location

All Customer Support data is available in your BigQuery instance under:
```
[sm-{{ company_id }}].[sm_experimental].obt_customer_support_tickets*
```
NOTE that this will eventually be moved to `sm_transformed_v2` dataset once the schema is more finalized.

The primary reporting table is `obt_customer_support_tickets`, which contains all metrics needed for dashboard visualizations.

## Key Metrics

The Customer Support data models track several key performance indicators:

### Ticket Performance
- **Average Resolution Time**: The average time (in hours) between ticket creation and resolution
- **One-Touch Resolution Rate**: Percentage of tickets resolved with a single agent interaction
- **Open Tickets**: Total number of tickets currently open
- **Resolution Distribution**: Distribution of tickets by resolution time (0-3 hours, 3-6 hours, etc.)
- **Ticket Aging**: Visualization of how long tickets remain open, with customizable time buckets

### Customer Satisfaction
- **CSAT Score**: Average customer satisfaction rating (1-5 scale)
- **CSAT Rating Distribution**: Breakdown of tickets by satisfaction rating
- **CSAT Survey Response Rate**: Percentage of closed tickets with completed CSAT surveys

### Volume & Channel Analysis
- **Tickets by Channel**: Distribution across channels (email, chat, social media, etc.)
- **Tickets Created/Closed**: Total tickets created/closed in the selected period
- **Messages per Ticket**: Average number of messages exchanged per ticket
- **Channel Efficiency**: Analyze which channels have the highest one-touch resolution rates

### Agent & Team Performance
- **Resolution Metrics by Agent**: Track individual agent performance metrics
- **Team Performance**: Compare metrics across support teams
- **CSAT by Agent**: Identify coaching opportunities and recognize top performers

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `sm_store_id` | SourceMedium Customer ID |
| `source_system` | The system where the ticket originated (e.g., "gorgias") |
| `ticket_communication_channel` | The communication channel (email, chat, social, etc.) |

## Dashboard Capabilities

The pre-built SourceMedium dashboard for Customer Support enables you to:

1. **Filter data** by time period, channel, resolution time, agent, team, and CSAT score
2. **Monitor key metrics** through time-series visualizations with period-over-period comparisons
3. **Analyze ticket resolution** by channel and customizable time buckets
4. **Track CSAT performance** and identify trends across agents and channels
5. **Measure agent and team performance** with detailed efficiency metrics
6. **Export data** for further analysis to CSV or Google Sheets
7. **Connect support data with customer segments** to understand how subscribers, first-time buyers, or high LTV customers experience your support

## Data Model Implementation

The Customer Support data models are implemented as a multi-layer transformation pipeline:

1. **Staging Layer**: Raw data from the Gorgias API is extracted and staged
2. **Fact/Dimension Layer**: Normalized data model with fact and dimension tables
3. **Output Business Tables (OBT)**: Analytics-ready tables optimized for reporting

The models are built using dbt and follow SourceMedium's unified data modeling approach, ensuring consistent metrics definitions across platforms and enabling seamless integration with your other business data.

## Common Use Cases

### For Dashboard Users

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track customer support team efficiency with resolution time and one-touch resolution metrics
2. **Channel Analysis**: Identify which support channels have the highest volume and best resolution rates
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: Monitor CSAT scores across channels and agents
4. **SLA Compliance**: Track tickets against resolution time targets
5. **Agent Coaching**: Identify agents who may need additional training or support based on resolution metrics
6. **Support Volume Planning**: Analyze ticket trends to anticipate staffing needs

### For Data Engineers

1. **Custom Reporting**: Build specialized reports using the underlying fact and dimension tables
2. **Data Integration**: Join customer support data with other business metrics
3. **Custom Metrics**: Define and calculate additional KPIs beyond the pre-built dashboard
4. **Historical Analysis**: Analyze trends and patterns in customer support performance over time
5. **Customer Journey Analysis**: Connect support interactions with purchase behavior and marketing touchpoints
6. **Segmentation Analysis**: Analyze support metrics across different customer segments (subscribers vs. one-time purchasers, high-value vs. low-value customers)

## Data Refresh Schedule

The Gorgias data is updated daily through an automated ETL pipeline. The latest data available will typically represent activity from the previous day.

## Technical Implementation

The Customer Support data models are implemented with the following technical features:

- **Incremental Loading**: Models use incremental loading patterns to efficiently process only new or changed data
- **Partitioning**: Tables are partitioned by date for efficient querying
- **Clustering**: Tables are clustered by key dimensions (smcid, source_system, and ticket_communication_channel)
- **Timezone Handling**: All timestamps are stored in both UTC and local store timezone for flexible reporting
- **Composite Keys**: Unique composite keys ensure data integrity across the model
- **Standardized Naming**: Consistent naming conventions across all SourceMedium data models

## Notes & Additional Resources

### Debug Considerations for Engineers

Export all Gorgias tickets by creating a Private view with no filters. [Instructions can be found here](https://docs.gorgias.com/en-US/exports-404844)

### Additional Tickets in Warehouse

Due to API limitations tickets that have been fully deleted from the Gorgias platform will still be visible and included in the reporting and fct/dim data models.

### Discrepancies vs. Gorgias internal analytics

You may notice discrepancies for day-over-day and aggregated metrics versus the SourceMedium calculated metrics. This is due to the method of aggregation utilized by Gorgias for their in-platform and API-provided analytics. Another factor that may cause discrepancies are user-account timezone settings. This is because Gorgias' in-platform analytics aggregates based on the timezone set for the user viewing them, whereas SourceMedium aggregates based on your e-commerce platform native timezone. Gorgias provides excellent documentation and visualizations on how they calculate their analytics figures, which can be [found here](https://docs.gorgias.com/en-US/how-metrics-are-calculated-406747).

### Customizing the Dashboard

The pre-built Looker Studio dashboard template is fully customizable:
- Time buckets for resolution time analysis can be adjusted to match your SLAs
- Additional metrics can be added using the underlying data model
- Custom segments can be created by joining with your customer data
- Visualizations can be modified or expanded based on your specific requirements
