### What Shopify data is available in Source Medium?

As one of the largest & most trusted e-commerce platforms on the market, we consider Shopify data to be 
source-of-truth for a large majority of sales & revenue use cases, and Shopify data is used widely throughout the Source Medium platform.

Source Medium ingests & aggregates a myriad of data points from Shopify spanning customer, order, line-item, 
and fulfillment performance (just to name a few)!  We aggregate relevant metadata points and tie them back to 
the customers/orders/line-item sales that are driving performance to build a more holistic picture of what you're selling, 
who you're selling to, and where they're coming from.

<Accordion title="Default filtering & exclusions">
- Source Medium considers **revenue from the sale of gift cards** to be deferred revenue, and therefor we do not report on this revenue until the gift card is redeemed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data enrichment - how is Shopify data blended with data from other platforms in Source Medium?">
In our ecosystem, Shopify data is often enriched with metadata from additional 
integrations.  For example...
- Google Analytics, Elevar, Littledata etc. for added order-level attribution
- ReCharge, StayAI etc. for additional subscription insights
</Accordion>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What additional configuration options are available for Shopify data?">
`[optional section]`

### Data cleaning & transformation notes

    - do we enrich this data with any other data or alter it in any way before reporting it in dashboards (before it reaches the final tables)
        - e.g. Shopify orders receive UTM enrichment from GA, Littledata, Elevar etc
- any freshness notes
    - e.g. for Amazon, data is fresh to the previous 48-72 hrs
- do we remove or filter anything automatically
        - e.g. we don't report on gift card revenue from Shopify
