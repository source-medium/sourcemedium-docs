### What GA4 data is available in SourceMedium?

While SourcMedium mainly uses GA4 data for enriched attribution of orders & customer acquisition (see Data Enrichment section), we also ingest data related 
to your site traffic -- which we pair against real orders data (as-reported by your sales platform) to build an accurate CVR picture.

Keep in mind that the data provided by GA is only as good as the tracking technology being used, which can be circumvented by customers using ad 
blockers or faulty tracking. For this reason, we use Shopify as our source of truth and use GA4 to enrich that data.

<Accordion title="Data Enrichment - How is GA4 data blended with data from other platforms in SourceMedium?">
    When integrating data, it's important to decide on a "most trustworthy" data source to use as a foundation (also called "source of truth" data). 
    At SourceMedium we use Shopify data as our source of truth for all sales data, as Shopify data is robust and represents real financial transactions 
    (meaning we won't be missing records of sales). 
    
    When we integrate Google Analytics data with Shopify data, we trust Shopify more than Google Analytics when it comes to the last-click attribution of 
    that order (where that order came from based on UTM parameters) - meaning if the two sources disagree, we will report what Shopify says.  This 
    hierarchy of trust is called our “Attribution Waterfall.” In short, when we report this integrated data, we are showing Shopify data which has been 
    enriched and expanded by Google Analytics.
    
    This enrichment can fill in gaps in both data sources — SourceMedium can regularly provide attribution for 10-30% more orders than Google Analytics 
    or Shopify on their own.

### Additional information
**Data Freshness:**
SourceMedium attempts to ingest data from the GA4 API every 6 hours, and fully transformed data should be available within data tables & 
dashboards by the next day.

**Other data clarifications: data nuances & good-to-knows**
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What do “Direct / None” & “None / None“ Source / Mediums mean?">
        - `(Direct) / (none)` means either customers visited your website directly (manually typing in the URL or hitting a bookmark) or something forced UTM tracking to break.
        - `(None) / (none)` traffic refers to visitors whose UTM source and medium values are both `null` and therefore cannot be identified by Google Analytics.
        If you're seeing one these `source / medium` values as a large bucket of your attribution, usually it means something can be improved!  You can read up 
        on how to improve your UTM tracking in Google Analytics [here](/data-inputs/platform-supporting-resources/ga4/improving-last-click-attribution).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="New vs returning customer accuracy">
        It is important to note that Google Analytics may not be able to distinguish between new and returning customers, as it does not have a total history 
        of your new versus repeat customers. To address this, SourceMedium has ingested historic data for your business to match a customer against those that 
        have been ingested to determine if that customer is new or returning.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Known reporting differences">
        Given SourceMedium stitches your GA4 data with your sales data to build the most accurate picture of attribution, often times there are reporting differences 
        between SourceMedium order & customer attribution and native GA4 & Shopify reporting.
