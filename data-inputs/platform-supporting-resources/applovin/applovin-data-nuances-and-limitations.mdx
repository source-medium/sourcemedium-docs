### AppLovin Only Reports In UTC Time

AppLovin currently reports all data in UTC time, both within their own UI and their API. 
As their data is primarily aggregated into a daily view, there is a potential that events will be attributed to a 
neignboring date.
 
For example, if your brand is based on the east coast of the United States during Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) your AppLovin data 
will be shifted forward by four hours (as EDT is UTC -4). Your daily AppLovin marketing cycle would begin & end daily at 8 PM EDT, 
as this would be 12 AM UTC and begin the next "UTC Day". If you then had additional AppLovin spend at 9:55 PM EDT, this spend will 
be attributed to the next day. 

Currently, the data that SourceMedium receives via the API is using this concept of the "UTC Day" and will directly match 
the report you can see in AppLovin's UI.
