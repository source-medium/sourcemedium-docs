### Historical Data: Amazon Sales Report

For historical data, we rely on the Amazon Sales report, which provides us with up to 24 months of past order data. 
However, due to Amazon's reporting processes, this data is subject to a 2-day delay, as stated 
in their documentation: "Business Reports will have a lag of 24 hours" before the data becomes available.

### Real-Time Data: Enriched Order Details

To complement historical data and provide more granular insights into your ongoing operations, we also use data 
from real-time APIs that capture enriched order details, such as charges, refunds, shipping costs, and promotions. 
This real-time data feed kicks in once you've integrated your Amazon account, enabling you to view up-to-the-minute 
performance metrics. However, please note that this real-time data will not be available for historical periods covered 
by the Sales report.

### FBA Returns: Delayed Reporting and Lookback Schedule

Amazon's reporting of FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) customer returns follows a specific process that introduces additional delays. 
The FBA return data that Amazon provides reflects returns that have been received at a fulfillment center. This means that a 
return will not appear in the report until it has been physically received and processed by Amazon, which can take over 30 days 
from the initial return request date due to Amazon's 30-day return window.

To account for these delays and ensure accurate return data, our data ingestion partner employs a lookback schedule for FBA 
Returns. While they request the current FBA returns report, Amazon may retroactively post updates to older reports with return 
information. To capture these updates, they check for changes to prior reports 7 and 35 days from the current date. 
For example, on July 30th, they request prior FBA return reports for July 23rd and June 25th, updating any return data 
that Amazon may have backdated.

### Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment

Orders fulfilled through Amazon's Multi-Channel Fulfillment program, which allows you to sell products on non-Amazon 
platforms while utilizing Amazon's fulfillment services, are classified under the "Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment" sales channel.

### Amazon Removal Orders

Amazon Removal Orders, which represent instances where products are removed from Amazon's fulfillment centers, are automatically 
categorized under the "Excluded" channel with a dedicated sales channel name of "Amazon Removal Order." This separation ensures 
that removal orders are clearly distinguished from active sales transactions.
