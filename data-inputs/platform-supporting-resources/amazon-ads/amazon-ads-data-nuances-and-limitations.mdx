### Historical Data Constraints

Amazon imposes specific limitations on the historical advertising data available through their APIs. 
For all advertising campaigns, the lookback period is capped at 60 days from the current date. This means that 
historical advertising data older than 60 days is not accessible through Amazon's API (or their reporting interfaces).

### API Versioning and Data Source Consolidation

Amazon is in the process of releasing a new version (v3) of their reporting API for Sponsored Advertising campaigns, 
including Sponsored Brands, Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display, and Sponsored Video. However, the rollout of this new 
API version has been phased, with only Sponsored Products officially available on the v3 API.

To accommodate this transition phase, our data ingestion partner has implemented two separate data connectors to 
ensure comprehensive coverage of your Amazon advertising performance:

1. **Sponsored Brands & Sponsored Display (v2 API)**: This connector interfaces with the previous version (v2) of Amazon's advertising API, allowing us to retrieve data for Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Display campaigns.
2. **Sponsored Products (v3 API)**: A dedicated connector leverages the new v3 API to access data for Sponsored Products campaigns, taking advantage of the latest API.

Our team is closely monitoring Amazon's API updates and roadmap to stay ahead of any changes. As Amazon introduces new 
features or modifies existing APIs, we will adapt our data integration processes accordingly.
