## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep data consistent">
    Use the same naming conventions across tabs. For example, if you call a channel "Meta" in one place, don't call it "Facebook" elsewhere.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update costs regularly">
    Product costs and shipping rates change. Set a recurring reminder to review and update your cost data quarterly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document your mappings">
    Add notes in the sheet explaining why certain orders are mapped to specific channels—future you will thank you.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
