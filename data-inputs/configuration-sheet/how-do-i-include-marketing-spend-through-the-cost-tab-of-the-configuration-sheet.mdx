### Requirements

Access to Configuration sheet to input custom marketing spend <br />

**If this is your first time using the Cost tab:**
    - Once all steps have been completed, reach out to the SourceMedium team in Slack (or [via email](mailto:support@sourcemedium.com)) letting us know you'd like to enable the custom costs feature

### Background

You can use the cost tab in your configuration sheet to include any `marketing spend` that is outside of your integrated platforms. Any spend that is added to the configuration sheet will then be included in the **Executive-level** and the **Marketing Overview** modules.

### **Steps**

1. Open your configuration sheet (find the link in `pinned messages` in your Slack channel)
    1. If not in Slack, email our team for access to your configuration sheet

    2. In the `Cost` tab, select the appropriate values for each column
        1. `category` - select `Marketing`
        2. `channel` - select the channel where you're expecting to see returns on this spend (Online DTC, Wholesale, etc.)
        3. `sub-channel` - select the sub-channel that the spend is associated with ([new sub-channels can also be added](/data-inputs/configuration-sheet/how_does_channel_mapping_work) within the `Configuration` tab)
            <br />
            <br /> **Any `sub_channel`containing the following terms (not case sensitive) will be pulled into the `Sponsorships & Influencers` module:**
                - `influencer`
                - `podcast`
                - `newsletter`
                - `affiliate`
                - `sponsorship`
        4. `vendor` - select the specific platform related to the spend (can add additional values in `Configuration` tab)
2. Enter your marketing spend in the `cost` column and applicable dates
    - `date_start` and `date_end` will amortize the cost for that spend across the range of `date_start` to `date_end`
        
        *e.g. \$1,000 spend from 10/1/2021 to 10/10/2021 would tack on $100 spend for each day. If no date_end is provided, all cost is attributed to `date_start`*
