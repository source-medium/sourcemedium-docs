### Steps

1. Open your SourceMedium Configuration Sheet at the link pinned in your SourceMedium shared slack Channel.

2. Open the `Targets` tab
3. Select a channel. This will be the sales channel that you are looking to track metrics for, i.e. `Online DTC` (Online DTC is the only option available at the moment for Target Setting as the feature is further developed).
4. Add a `date_start`  in order to indicate when the goal is being tracked starts (We encourage MTD tracking).
5. Add a `date_end`, this sets the period of time that you want the target amortized across. If left blank it will all be set for the `date_start` day. 
    
    *(i.e. You set \$1m revenue for 11/1 but don't set the end date your target will be $1m for the single day, not spread across the month).*
6. Add target values to the metrics you'd like to track.
