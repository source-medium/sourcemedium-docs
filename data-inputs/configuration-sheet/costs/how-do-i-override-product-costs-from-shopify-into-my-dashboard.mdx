### Requirements

Inserted **product costs** on the **Financial Cost - Product COGS** tab on the configuration sheet

### Background

Keeping track of `product costs` is crucial for your business. It is a significant expense that directly affects your profitability on an customer, order and product level and is included as part our COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and Gross Profit metrics.

### Steps

1. Input your **Override Shopify Product Costs** within your **Configuration Sheet**
    1. Go to the **Financial Cost - Product COGS** Tab 
    2. Enter the below: 
        - category = Financial
        - sm_channel Online DTC 
        - expense_channel = Product COGS
        - SKU
        - product cost - *This is your cost per product* 
        - date_start
        - date_end <br /> 
    
    *Note: date_start and date_end can be used to capture changes in product costs over time. You will be able to change these date fields historically and in the future in case of updates to product costs and our data model will update accordingly. 
        It is imperative to make sure you include a date_end date as the row will not be included if there is not date_end included.*
