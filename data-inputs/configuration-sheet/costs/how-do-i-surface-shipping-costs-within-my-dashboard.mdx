### Requirements

Inserted **shipping costs** on the **Financial Cost - Shipping** tab on the configuration sheet

### Background

Keeping track of `shipping costs` is crucial for your business. It is a significant expense that directly affects your profitability on an customer, order and product level and is included as part our COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and Gross Profit metrics.

### Steps

1. Input your **Shipping Costs** within your **Configuration Sheet**
    1. Go to the **Financial Cost - Shipping** Tab 
    2. Enter the below: 
        - category = Financial
        - channel (e.g. Online DTC, Amazon) 
        - expense_channel = Shipping Cost
        - region - *If the region you want to add is not a part of the drop down, please let the team know and we will add it.*
        - fixed cost/order - *This is your shipping cost per order*
        - date_start
        - date_end <br />
        
    *Note: date_start and date_end can be used to capture changes in shipping costs over time. You will be able to change these date fields historically and in the future in case of updates to shipping costs and our data model will update accordingly.* 
        
        *It is imperative to make sure you include a date_end date as the row will not be included if there is not date_end included.*
