### Requirements

Inserted **fulfillment costs** on the **Financial Cost - Fulfillment** tab on the configuration sheet

### Background

Tracking `fulfillment costs` is crucial for your business. It is a significant expense that directly affects your profitability on an customer, order and product level and is included as part our COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and Gross Profit metrics.

### Steps

1. Input your **Fulfillment Costs** within your **Configuration Sheet**
    1. Go to the **Financial Cost - Fulfillment** Tab 
    2. Enter the below: 
        - category = Financial
        - channel (e.g. Online DTC, Amazon) 
        - expense_channel = Fulfillment Cost
        - region - *If the region you want to add is not a part of the drop down, please let the team know and we will add it.*
        - fixed cost/order - *This is your fulfillment cost per order*
        - date_start
        - date_end<br /> 
        
    *Note: Date_start and date_end can be used to capture changes in fulfillment costs over time. You will be able to change these date fields historically and in the future in case of updates to fulfillment costs and our data model will update accordingly.* 
    
    *It is imperative to make sure you include a date_end date as the order/row will not be included if it does not have a date_end date.*

2. Please let the SourceMedium team know that you've inputted the fulfillment costs and we will enable costs to be picked up automatically moving forward. *Historic data can be inputted into this sheet to update the costs of prior orders as well.*
