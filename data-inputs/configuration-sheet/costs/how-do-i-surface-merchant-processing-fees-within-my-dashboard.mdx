### Requirements

Inserted **merchant processing fees** on the **Financial Cost - Merchant Processing Fees** tab on the configuration sheet

### Background

Keeping track of **`merchant processing fees`** is crucial in your business. It is a significant expense that directly affects your profitability on an customer, order and product level and is included as part our COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and Gross Profit metrics.

### Steps

1. Input your **Merchant Processing Fees** within your **Configuration Sheet**
    1. Go to the **Financial Cost - Merchant Processing Fees** Tab 
    2. Enter the below: 
        - category = Financial
        - channel 
        - expense_channel = Merchant Processing Fees
        - region - *If the region you want to add is not a part of the drop down, please let the team know and we will add it.*
        - payment processor
        - fixed cost/order - *This is your fixed merchant processing fees per order*
        - variable cost/order - *This number (usually a percent) is multiplied by the total_revenue of the order and rounded to 2 decimal places.* 
            - **The variable cost/order + fixed cost per order will give you the total merchant processing fee for the order**
        - date_start
        - date_end <br />
    
    *Note: Date_start and date_end can be used to capture changes in fulfillment costs over time. You will be able to change these date fields historically and in the future in case of updates to fulfillment costs and our data model will update accordingly.* 
    
    *It is imperative to make sure you include a date_end date as the order/row will not be included if it does not have a date_end date.*
