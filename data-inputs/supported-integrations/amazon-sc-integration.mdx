## Follow this integration guide to connect your Amazon Seller Central (Selling Partner) data to Source Medium.

### Requirements

- **Admin access** to your Amazon Seller Central account
- Be able to add Source Medium as a new user and adjust permissions
- Premium Integration

### FAQ

- Do we really need to grant Source Medium all these permissions?
    - Since the SP-API is so new, the permissions are necessary for us to programmatically access all of the most important data. If we ever become aware of decreased permissions for certain roles, we will let you know ASAP. Rest assured, we take our data security very seriously at Source Medium and your data will never be used for any purposes outside of reporting without your explicit consent.

### **Steps**

Add Source Medium as a user in Seller Central
