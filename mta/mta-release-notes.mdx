This document outlines the key updates and improvements to the Source Medium Multi-Touch Attribution system. We regularly enhance our attribution capabilities to provide more accurate insights and better reporting.

## Version 1.34 - Linear Attribution Deduplication

We've significantly improved how linear attribution handles repeated touchpoints to provide more accurate marketing effectiveness insights.

### What Changed

Linear attribution now uses **session-based deduplication** to ensure each unique marketing contribution is counted only once per user session. This prevents over-attribution when customers interact with the same channel multiple times in a single session.

### Before vs. After Comparison

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    **Scenario**: Customer visits your site 3 times via Facebook ads in one morning session
    
    - Each visit counted as a separate touchpoint
    - Linear credit: 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 100% to Facebook
    - Result: Over-attribution to repetitive touches
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="After">
    **Scenario**: Same customer journey
    
    - Only first Facebook touch in the session receives credit
    - Subsequent Facebook touches in same session = $0 attribution
    - Result: More accurate view of unique marketing contributions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Impact on Your Data

<Warning>
**Expected Changes**: Linear revenue will typically increase by 20-60%. This is correct behavior - the attribution is now more accurately distributed among unique contributions rather than being diluted by repeated touches.
</Warning>

- **First Touch Attribution**: No change
- **Last Touch Attribution**: No change  
- **Linear Attribution**: 
  - Revenue per channel may increase significantly
  - Fewer touchpoints receive attribution credit
  - More accurate representation of marketing effectiveness

### Technical Details

For data analysts and technical users:

- Deduplication uses `event_user_session_id` to identify unique sessions
- New flags `is_first_occurrence_*` indicate which touches receive attribution
- Multipliers now calculated on `unique_dimension_value_count` instead of total touch count
- Available for all dimensions: marketing channels, ads, campaigns, ad groups, landing pages, and email/SMS

## Version 1.20 - Brand Campaign Inclusion

Brand campaigns are now included in reporting without receiving attribution credit. This allows you to:

- View brand campaign performance metrics alongside non-brand campaigns
- Filter brand campaigns in dashboards while seeing platform data
- Access complete campaign metadata for reporting purposes

This change provides better visibility into your brand campaigns while maintaining the attribution integrity of non-brand marketing efforts.

## Version 1.18 - Enhanced Channel-Level Performance Data

We've improved the attribution system to include comprehensive channel-level performance metrics alongside ad-level data:

- Channel performance metrics now include previously unattributed data
- More accurate representation of total marketing performance by channel
- Consistent reporting between ad-level and channel-level analyses

This enhancement provides a more complete picture of your marketing channel performance while maintaining detailed ad-level attribution.

## Version 1.12 - Dedicated Email/SMS Attribution Dimension

Email and SMS marketing now have their own dedicated attribution dimension:

- Separate tracking for email and SMS marketing performance
- Message ID extraction for precise campaign attribution
- Improved display format showing "[Channel][Type] Name" (e.g., "[Email][Flow] Welcome Series")
- Intelligent flow/campaign detection for better readability
- Connection to message performance data for comprehensive analysis

This dedicated dimension provides deeper insights into how your email and SMS campaigns contribute to your marketing success.

## Version 1.08 - Attribution Model Refinement

We've refined how the attribution system handles Email/SMS channels:

- Email/SMS channels no longer receive credit in first touch and linear attribution models
- Email/SMS can still receive last touch attribution for specific customers
- Credit previously given to Email/SMS is now distributed to other marketing channels
- More accurate representation of how customers discover your brand

This change provides a more balanced view of which channels are truly driving initial discovery versus conversion.
