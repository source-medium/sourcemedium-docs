This document outlines the key updates and improvements to the Source Medium Multi-Touch Attribution system. We regularly enhance our attribution capabilities to provide more accurate insights and better reporting.

## Version 1.20 - Brand Campaign Inclusion

Brand campaigns are now included in reporting without receiving attribution credit. This allows you to:

- View brand campaign performance metrics alongside non-brand campaigns
- Filter brand campaigns in dashboards while seeing platform data
- Access complete campaign metadata for reporting purposes

This change provides better visibility into your brand campaigns while maintaining the attribution integrity of non-brand marketing efforts.

## Version 1.18 - Enhanced Channel-Level Performance Data

We've improved the attribution system to include comprehensive channel-level performance metrics alongside ad-level data:

- Channel performance metrics now include previously unattributed data
- More accurate representation of total marketing performance by channel
- Consistent reporting between ad-level and channel-level analyses

This enhancement provides a more complete picture of your marketing channel performance while maintaining detailed ad-level attribution.

## Version 1.12 - Dedicated Email/SMS Attribution Dimension

Email and SMS marketing now have their own dedicated attribution dimension:

- Separate tracking for email and SMS marketing performance
- Message ID extraction for precise campaign attribution
- Improved display format showing "[Channel][Type] Name" (e.g., "[Email][Flow] Welcome Series")
- Intelligent flow/campaign detection for better readability
- Connection to message performance data for comprehensive analysis

This dedicated dimension provides deeper insights into how your email and SMS campaigns contribute to your marketing success.

## Version 1.08 - Attribution Model Refinement

We've refined how the attribution system handles Email/SMS channels:

- Email/SMS channels no longer receive credit in first touch and linear attribution models
- Email/SMS can still receive last touch attribution for specific customers
- Credit previously given to Email/SMS is now distributed to other marketing channels
- More accurate representation of how customers discover your brand

This change provides a more balanced view of which channels are truly driving initial discovery versus conversion.
