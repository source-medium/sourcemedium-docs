### <Icon icon="sitemap" iconType="solid" size={32}/>  What is Source Medium Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)?

Our model provides a comprehensive view of how various marketing efforts contribute to customer purchases. 
By unifying data from multiple sources of first party data you already own, we construct detailed purchase journeys that help you understand the impact of different marketing channels, landing pages, and ad creatives.

In the sections below, this document will provide everything you need to know to get started with Source Medium 
MTA.

  <Step title="What composes multi-touch attribution data and how is it described?">
    Marketing interactions happen with customers in the form of **touch points**—many touch points make up a **purchase journey**, and many purchase journeys make up a **multi-touch attribution data set**. Click the tabs below to read more about each of these concepts.

    <Tabs>

      <Tab title="Touch Points">
        - A **touch point** is an event, occurring before a purchase, where an interaction with a customer is made and touch point data is captured
        - **Touch point data** must contain at least one of the following to be considered valid: a landing page, an ad creative, or a marketing channel (mapped UTM data)
        - Add to carts, purchases, and confirmations are touch points, but they are not the primary focus of the Source Medium MTA model as they do not provide attribution insights
        - Touch points are only valid within the **lookback window**, which is 120 days before the customer makes their purchase
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Purchase Journey">
        - A **purchase journey** includes all recorded touch points leading up to a purchase made by a customer, an example is displayed in the figure below
        - Source Medium MTA standardizes purchase journeys to the [GA4 E-Commerce Event Schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267735?hl=en) that you may already be familiar with
        - There are often many data sources reporting many purchase journeys for each purchase, Source Medium MTA selects the highest quality purchase journey available by number of valid touch points—read more on this in the modeling section below
        
        <img src="/images/article-imgs/mta/purchase_journey.png" />
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Multi-Touch Attribution Dataset">
        - With the best purchase journey selected for each customer purchase, the collection of these journeys tells a detailed story of how marketing efforts bring in business
        - You can interact with the Source Medium MTA dataset through pre-built analysis modules and even by building your own charts or BI solutions directly on top of the modeled dataset—read more on this in the reporting section below

  </Step>

  <Step title="Where Does Multi-Touch Attribution Data Come From, and How is it Modeled?">
    Source Medium MTA takes multiple data sources reporting many customer journeys, unifies them into a single schema and assesses their quality, then combines the best of those purchase journeys with Marketing Data, Orders Data, Customer Data, and User Inputs to create a Unified Purchase Journey Dataset. View this process in the figure below.

    <img src="/images/article-imgs/mta/mta_architecture.png" />

    <Tabs>

      <Tab title="MTA Architecture">
      1. Source Medium integrates first-party purchase funnel data from a variety of **data sources**, you’ll see them listed and categorized on the left-hand side of the chart above
      2. The purchase journeys from all data sources are assessed for quality by number of valid touch points and the best are selected, this creates the **Unified Event Schema** you’ll see in the middle of the chart
      3. The Unified event Schema is combined with Marketing Data, Orders Data, Customer Data, and User Inputs using the appropriate identifier matching for each to create a set of **Unified Purchase Journeys** which you’ll see on the right-hand side of the chart
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Attribution Modeling">
      Source Medium models attribution in three key ways:
      1. **First Touch Attribution:** 
        - Assigns all credit to the first valid touch point in the purchase journey
        - Ideal for understanding initial customer acquisition channels
      2. **Last-Touch Attribution**
        - Assigns all credit to the last valid touch point before the purchase
        - Useful for identifying conversion-driving channels
      3. **Linear Attribution**
        - Distributes credit equally among all valid touch points
        - Provides a balanced and complete view across the entire purchase journey

  <Step title="How can I Analyze Source Medium Multi-Touch Data?">
    Source Medium MTA data architecture and modeling powers a robust suite of detailed reports to help you analyze and optimize your marketing efforts. If desired, you can customize these MTA reports for your use case—and you can even build custom BI solutions or train machine learning models directly on top of the Unified Purchase Journey MTA data from your managed data warehouse. 

    <Note>If you're already familiar with Source Medium MTA, or you'd like to just get started with analysis, feel free to skip the Reporting Definitions below and move ahead to the MTA Built-in Reports section.</Note>

    <AccordionGroup>

      <Accordion title="Key MTA Reporting Definitions">
        **Model Dimension**
        - In the specific case of Source Medium MTA, model dimension refers to the type of touch point being analyzed
        - There are 3 model dimension types used in Source Medium MTA:
          - **Marketing Channels (mapped UTM)**
          - **Ads**
          - **Landing Pages**

        <Tip>_Example:_ Selecting the **model dimension: Ads** will display touch point data where customers interacted with an advertisement before making a purchase</Tip> 

        **Attributable vs. Non-attributable**
        - The attributable value is true when there is at least one touch point, for a given model dimension, on a given customer purchase
        - The attributable value is false (non-attributable) when there are no touch points for a given model dimension, on a given customer purchase
        - Purchases and revenue are both attributable metrics, for each of the three model dimensions

        <Tip>_Example:_ A pie chart showing **Marketing Channel Attributable Revenue** is displaying the percentage of Revenue for which at least one touch point exists, when viewing touch points of the Marketing Channel (mapped UTM) type</Tip> 

        **Distinct Dimension Values**
        - Distinct dimension values is a count of the number of _unique_ touch points, for a given model dimension
        - The same Marketing Channel, Ad ID, or Landing Page will not be counted as a distinct dimension value more than once even if a customer interacts with it multiple times

        <Tip>_Example:_ A customer purchase journey that includes 3 distinct ad views before a purchase will have a **distinct dimension value** of 3, for the Ads model dimension</Tip> 

        - Changing the Minimum Distinct Dimension Values setting will filter out customer purchase journeys with fewer than the entered number of touch points, for the selected model dimension

        <Tip>_Example:_ A **Minimum Distinct Dimension Values** setting of 3 for the Landing Pages model dimension will filter out all purchase journeys with less than 3 distinct landing pages recorded</Tip> 

        **Attribution Type**
        - Source Medium MTA modeling enables three different attribution types:
          - **First Touch:** Assigns all credit to the first valid touch point in the purchase journey
          - **Last Touch:** Assigns all credit to the last valid touch point before the purchase
          - **Linear:** Distributes credit equally among all valid touch points

        <Tip>_Example:_ A purchase journey in which the customer first interacted with a Google ad, second a TikTok ad, and third a Meta ad before then making a purchase would give credit solely to Google via **First Touch Attribution**, and would give credit solely to Meta via **Last Touch Attribution**—but would distribute one third of the credit each to Google, Meta, and TikTok via **Linear Attribution**.</Tip> 

        **Days to Conversion**
        - This is the number of days between the first touch point in a customer purchase journey and the purchase date
        - This value is dependent upon the selected model dimension

        <Tip>_Examples:_ **Days to Conversion** for the Landing Page model dimension is the number of days between the first Landing Page interaction the customer made and the purchase <br/><br/>
        **Days to Conversion** for the Marketing Channel model dimension is the number of days between the first customer interaction with a Marketing Channel and the purchase</Tip> 

        **Source System**
        - The source system is the data platform from which a given customer purchase journey was selected

        <Tip>_Examples:_ Google Analytics, Elevar, and Blotout are **Source Systems** used by Source medium MTA</Tip>
