# Brand Campaign Attribution

Source Medium's MTA system handles brand campaigns differently from non-brand campaigns. This document explains how brand campaigns are treated in attribution models and how to interpret their data.

## What Are Brand Campaigns?

Brand campaigns are marketing initiatives that target users already familiar with your brand, typically using branded search terms, remarketing audiences, or other brand-specific targeting methods. Common examples include:

- Google Search ads for your company name
- Meta ads targeted at your page's followers
- Retargeting campaigns to previous site visitors

## How Brand Campaigns Are Handled in MTA

In Source Medium's MTA system, brand campaigns are treated with special rules:

### 1. Zero Attribution Credit

- Brand campaigns appear in performance data but receive **zero attribution credit**
- The attribution metrics (first-touch, last-touch, linear) are all set to zero
- This prevents over-attribution to brand terms customers would search for anyway

### 2. Complete Performance Metrics

- All campaign metadata, spend, impressions, and clicks are preserved
- This allows complete performance reporting alongside attribution metrics
- You can see exactly how much you're spending on brand campaigns

### 3. Attribution Redistribution

- Attribution credit that would have gone to brand campaigns is redistributed to non-brand touchpoints
- This provides a more accurate picture of which marketing activities truly drive incremental business

## Brand Campaign Identification

Campaigns are identified as brand campaigns when:

1. Campaign tactic is explicitly set to "brand" (`ad_campaign_tactic = 'brand'`)
2. Campaign name contains "brand" but not "non-brand"
3. For search campaigns, when using branded search terms

## Analyzing Brand Campaign Performance

While brand campaigns don't receive attribution credit, they remain important to analyze:

### Metrics to Monitor

- **Traditional Performance**: Clicks, impressions, CTR
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per click, CPM
- **Platform-Reported Metrics**: Conversions and revenue as reported by the platform
- **Competitors Bidding**: Whether competitors are targeting your brand terms

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Brand vs. Non-Brand Campaign Performance
SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN lower(ad_campaign_tactic) = 'brand' THEN 'Brand' 
    ELSE 'Non-Brand' 
  END as campaign_type,
  SUM(ad_spend) as total_spend,
  SUM(ad_impressions) as total_impressions,
  SUM(ad_clicks) as total_clicks,
  SUM(ad_platform_reported_conversions) as platform_conversions,
  SUM(ad_platform_reported_revenue) as platform_revenue,
  SUM(sm_first_touch_revenue) as attributed_revenue,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(sm_first_touch_revenue), SUM(ad_spend)) as attributed_roas
FROM `customers-managed.masterset.rpt_ad_attribution_performance_daily`
WHERE 
  smcid = 'your-smcid'
  AND date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE()
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

```sql
-- Brand Campaign Metrics Over Time
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC(date, MONTH) as month,
  SUM(ad_spend) as brand_spend,
  SUM(ad_impressions) as brand_impressions,
  SUM(ad_clicks) as brand_clicks,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(ad_clicks), SUM(ad_impressions)) as ctr,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(ad_spend), SUM(ad_clicks)) as cpc
FROM `customers-managed.masterset.rpt_ad_attribution_performance_daily`
WHERE 
  smcid = 'your-smcid'
  AND lower(ad_campaign_tactic) = 'brand'
  AND date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

## Business Implications

### Why Brand Campaigns Receive Zero Attribution

1. **Incremental Value**: Brand campaigns often target users who would have found you anyway
2. **Last-Click Bias**: Brand campaigns typically occur late in the customer journey
3. **Budget Allocation**: Attributing to brand campaigns can lead to overinvestment in non-incremental marketing

### When Brand Campaigns Matter

Despite receiving zero attribution credit, brand campaigns can still be valuable:

- **Competitive Defense**: Protecting your brand terms from competitors
- **Return Path Creation**: Providing an easy way back for customers considering your brand
- **Remarketing Efficiency**: Re-engaging visitors who showed previous interest

### Balanced Approach to Brand Campaigns

Source Medium's approach allows you to:

1. **See Complete Data**: All brand campaign performance metrics are visible
2. **Make Informed Decisions**: Compare platform-reported vs. attributed metrics
3. **Proper Budget Allocation**: Invest in truly incremental marketing while maintaining appropriate brand presence

## Customizing Brand Campaign Handling

If your business has unique requirements for brand campaign attribution, Source Medium can implement custom rules. Some options include:

- **Partial Attribution**: Allowing brand campaigns to receive some attribution credit
- **Custom Brand Definition**: Refining what constitutes a "brand" campaign for your business
- **Advanced Models**: Implementing incrementality testing or other advanced attribution approaches
