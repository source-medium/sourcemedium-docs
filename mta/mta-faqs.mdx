    <Accordion title="What is Attributable Revenue? What are Attributable Purchases?">
        - The **attributable** value is true when there is at least one touch point, for a given model dimension, on a given customer purchase
        - The **attributable** value is false (non-attributable) when there are no touch points for a given model dimension, on a given customer purchase
        - **Purchases** and **Revenue** are both attributable metrics, for each of the three model dimensions

        <Tip>_Example:_ A pie chart showing **Marketing Channel Attributable Revenue** is displaying the percentage of Revenue for which at least one touch point exists, when viewing touch points of the Marketing Channel (mapped UTM) type</Tip>

    <Accordion title="What is Multi-Touch Attribution?">
        **Multi-Touch Attribution** is a type of marketing data model which accounts for the many marketing interactions each customer has with your business before a purchase, rather than only accounting for a single interaction as many typical marketing models do. 

        Marketing interactions happen with customers in the form of **touch points**—many touch points make up a **purchase journey**, and many purchase journeys make up a **multi-touch attribution data set**. Click the tabs below to read more about each of these concepts.

    <Accordion title="How do I use Source Medium MTA built-in reporting?">
        **Source Medium MTA Built-in Reports** are part of a standalone dashboard separate from your main Source Medium dash. After MTA is enabled for your account, the dashboard link will be pinned to your shared Slack channel or sent via email/gchat if you do not use Slack.

        <Note>For a description of each of the default modules and their functionality, see the Built-in Reporting dropdown from section 3 of our [MTA Overview](/mta/mta-overview)</Note>
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="What are the three attribution types within Source Medium MTA?">
        - Source Medium MTA modeling enables three different attribution types:
          - **First Touch:** Assigns all credit to the first valid touch point in the purchase journey
          - **Last Touch:** Assigns all credit to the last valid touch point before the purchase
          - **Linear:** Distributes credit equally among all valid touch points

        <Tip>_Example:_ A purchase journey in which the customer first interacted with a Google ad, second a TikTok ad, and third a Meta ad before then making a purchase would give credit solely to Google via **First Touch Attribution**, and would give credit solely to Meta via **Last Touch Attribution**—but would distribute one third of the credit each to Google, Meta, and TikTok via **Linear Attribution**.</Tip>
