# Email & SMS Attribution

SourceMedium's MTA system handles Email and SMS channels differently from other marketing channels. This special treatment is designed to provide a more accurate picture of acquisition performance while still recognizing the conversion power of owned marketing channels.

## Special Attribution Rules for Email & SMS

### Why Email/SMS Attribution Works Differently

Email and SMS are unique marketing channels because:

1. **Existing Relationship Required**: Unlike acquisition channels, Email and SMS require a prior relationship with the customer.
2. **Skewed Attribution**: Without special rules, Email/SMS often receives disproportionate credit in first-touch and linear models.
3. **Over-attribution Risk**: Including Email/SMS in all attribution models can lead to under-valuing true acquisition channels.

### Email/SMS Attribution Rules

To address these unique characteristics, SourceMedium MTA applies the following rules:

1. **First-Touch Attribution**: 
   - Email/SMS channels do not receive first-touch attribution credit
   - Credit goes to the earliest non-Email/SMS touch point instead
   - For journeys with only Email/SMS touches, no first-touch attribution is assigned

2. **Linear Attribution**:
   - Email/SMS touches are excluded from linear attribution
   - Credit is distributed only among non-Email/SMS touches
   - For journeys with only Email/SMS touches, no linear attribution is assigned

3. **Last-Touch Attribution**:
   - Special customer-specific rules apply
   - By default, Email/SMS is excluded from last-touch attribution
   - For specific customers (currently only Elix Healing), Email/SMS can receive last-touch attribution
   - This configuration is managed via the `is_email_sms_last_touch_enabled` setting

4. **Email/SMS-Only Journeys**:
   - Journeys where *all* touches are Email/SMS are generally not attributable
   - These journeys show as "unattributed" in attribution reports
   - Exception: Last-touch attribution for specific customers

## Dedicated Email/SMS Dimension

To provide visibility into Email and SMS performance while maintaining these special rules, SourceMedium MTA includes a dedicated "email_sms" dimension.

### Email/SMS Dimension Features

- **Message ID Extraction**: Identifies specific email or SMS messages using:
  1. `utm_id` (primary - used by Klaviyo and other ESPs)
  2. `utm_content` (fallback option)
  3. `utm_term` (secondary fallback)

- **Display Format**: `[channel]message_id`
  - Example: "[email]123456" or "[sms]789012"

- **Connection to Message Performance**: Links to engagement metrics from `rpt_outbound_message_performance_daily`

### Benefits of the Dedicated Dimension

This approach provides the best of both worlds:
- **Acquisition Accuracy**: By excluding Email/SMS from first touch and linear models, you get a clearer picture of which channels truly acquire customers
- **Email/SMS Visibility**: Through the dedicated dimension, you still see the impact of Email/SMS on conversions
- **Flexible Customer Configuration**: Customer-specific settings allow for business model adaptations

## Analyzing Email/SMS Performance

### Attribution Reports

While Email/SMS channels generally do not receive attribution in first-touch and linear models, you can still analyze their performance:

1. **Last-Touch Analysis** (for enabled customers):
   - See which Email/SMS messages are most effective at closing sales
   - Compare last-touch attribution to Email/SMS performance metrics

2. **Email/SMS Dimension Analysis**:
   - Track which messages appear in customer journeys
   - Identify the Email/SMS messages most frequently associated with purchases

### Example Analysis Queries

```sql
-- Email messages that appear most frequently in purchase journeys
SELECT
  dimension_value.email_sms as message_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT purchase_order_id) as journey_count
FROM `your_project.sm_experimental.obt_purchase_journeys_with_mta_models`
WHERE
  sm_store_id = 'your-sm_store_id'
  AND dimension_value.email_sms IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 20
```

```sql
-- Email performance metrics with last-touch attribution
-- (only for customers with Email/SMS last-touch enabled)
	SELECT
	  r.campaign_name,
	  COUNT(DISTINCT r.message_id) as message_count,
	  SUM(r.message_unique_receives) as deliveries,
	  SUM(r.message_unique_opens) as opens,
	  SUM(r.message_unique_clicks) as clicks,
	  SUM(a.last_touch_revenue) as last_touch_revenue,
	  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(a.last_touch_revenue), NULLIF(SUM(r.message_unique_receives), 0)) as revenue_per_delivery
	FROM `your_project.sm_transformed_v2.rpt_outbound_message_performance_daily` r
	LEFT JOIN (
	  SELECT
	    dimension_value.email_sms as message_id,
	    SUM(last_touch_revenue_impact.email_sms) as last_touch_revenue
  FROM `your_project.sm_experimental.obt_purchase_journeys_with_mta_models`
  WHERE
    sm_store_id = 'your-sm_store_id'
    AND sm_event_name = 'purchase'
    AND last_touch_revenue_impact.email_sms > 0
  GROUP BY 1
) a ON r.message_id = a.message_id
WHERE
  r.sm_store_id = 'your-sm_store_id'
  AND r.sm_message_channel IN ('email', 'sms')
  AND r.date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE()
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 7 DESC
```

## Business Impact

These Email/SMS attribution rules provide several business benefits:

1. **More Accurate Channel Valuation**: Acquisition channels get proper credit for bringing in new customers
2. **Better Budget Allocation**: Prevents overinvestment in email at the expense of true acquisition channels
3. **Clearer Marketing Funnel**: Distinguishes between acquisition and retention/conversion channels
4. **Adaptable to Business Models**: Customer-specific settings accommodate different business needs

For businesses where Email/SMS plays a significant role in acquisition (e.g., referral programs delivered via email), custom attribution rules can be implemented. Contact your SourceMedium account manager to discuss your specific needs.
