SCRIPT: 

Your executive summary is a high level, blended view of all your integrated data. This is where you can view the overall health of your business. For example you can track what the most important key performance indicators are for your business, sales performance, acquisition performance, marketing efficiency and new vs. repeat customers.
There are over 100 metrics to choose from to view in your Executive Summary. The link at the top of the module will bring you to the full list.

The Executive Summary mimics transaction-based reporting.
Example: The day on which the refund is made and is recorded like a transaction log, much as you would for accounting purposes

First step is your executive summary module. This module is an overview of the overall health of your brand. This includes all integrated data, sources, marketing and sales and subscriptions, etc. and itâ€™s a blender do you have all of those sources and includes prudent KPIs.

The executive summary works like the Shopify sales report as it is transaction based that means each order and return is logged.

<Accordion title="Potential reporting differences & discrepancies">
    
    The Executive Summary is designed to mirror the accounting rules present in the Shopify Sales Report, and will almost always match 1:1.  However, there are some instances where you won't see a 1:1 match:
    
    1. If your brand has our `Exclude $0 Orders` feature enabled, you will see a revenue and orders mismatch. This feature excludes orders with a total revenue of $0 from all Executive Summary and Retention dashboard data. If you're unsure if you have this feature enabled, reach out to our Support team in Slack or via email at [help@sourcemedium.com](mailto:help@sourcemedium.com).
    
    [See here for a deeper explanation of this feature](https://help.sourcemedium.com/articles/exclude-0-orders-feature-overview)
    
    2. If your brand has any data cleaning rules in the Channel Mapping tab your Configuration Sheet-- e.g. any rules routing orders to a channel other than Online DTC -- you will see a mismatch if only Online DTC is selected in the channel dropdown (located at the top right-hand corner of your report, under the date range filter).
    
    If you are running sales through Amazon, be sure to deselect "Amazon" in the channel dropdown when comparing sales data between the Executive Summary and Shopify Sales report.
