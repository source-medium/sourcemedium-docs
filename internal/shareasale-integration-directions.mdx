# Overview

Shareasale is an affiliate network marketing platform and one of our [existing integrations](https://help.sourcemedium.com/integration-docs) offered to customers - when we receive data it surfaces in the executive summary and marketing overview modules. To set up an integration with a customer, we’ll follow these steps:

1. Make sure they have our external-facing integration instructions [here](https://help.sourcemedium.com/articles/connect-connect-shareasale-data-to-source-medium) so that they can email the **Token, API Secret, and Merchant ID** credentials to [integrations@sourcemedium.com](mailto:integrations@sourcemedium.com)
2. Once they do, find the email and record their credentials
3. Log into [Funnel.io](https://app.funnel.io/#/account/-Myh3LeCk8GHAzBGnPaK/datasources)
4. Navigate to data sources and click “Connect Data Source”
