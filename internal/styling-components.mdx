Mintlify's documentation is pretty good, and can be found [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart)



### Components to use often
#### Accordians & Accordian Groups
Accordians are dropdown components for toggling content, allowing users to opt-in to / hide certain information.  These can be great tools for backing in added context & info without creating visual clutter.

```markdown HelloWorld.mdx
<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here.
</Accordion>
```
<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here.
</Accordion>

Accordian Groups aggregate multiple Accordian component under a single element.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FAQ without Icon">
    You can put other components inside Accordions.

    ```java HelloWorld.java
    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="FAQ with Icon" icon="alien-8bit">
    Check out the [Accordion](/content/components/accordion) docs for all the supported props.

#### Reusable Snippets

``` markdown tooltip-CPA.mdx
<Tooltip tip="CPA = Spend / New Customers">CPA</Tooltip>
```
```markdown
<Snippet file="snippet-example.mdx" />
```
<Snippet file="tooltip-CPA.mdx"/>

#### Hover Tooltips

<Tooltip tip="This is a tooltip!">Hover over me</Tooltip>
