#### Accordion

### `Snippets` & `Snippets` w/ `Tooltips`
Using a tooltip as a snippet seems to work fine:
```markdown
<Snippet file="tooltip-CPA.mdx"/>
```
<Snippet file="tooltip-CPA.mdx"/>

However, wrapping that snippet in an `<Info>` element does not allow tooltip to expand:
```markdown
<Info><Snippet file="tooltip-CPA.mdx"/></Info>
```
<Info><Snippet file="tooltip-CPA.mdx"/></Info>

Calling a  snippet inline breaks page, issue acknowledged by Mintlify
```markdown
Cost per acquisition, or <Snippet file="tooltip-CPA.mdx" /> is a representation of how much it costs (in terms of marketing dollars) to acquire a new customer
