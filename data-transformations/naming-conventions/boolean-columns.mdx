### Overview

Boolean columns are named to clearly reflect a true or false condition, and are always phrased in the form of a question. 
This convention helps in understanding the purpose of the column at a glance, indicating a specific dimension of an entity 
that can either be true or false.

### Boolean column name formula
`is_{{ entity }}_{{ dimension }}`

### Examples

- `is_price_tax_inclusive`, where `price` is the `entity` and `tax_inclusive` is the `dimension` 
indicating whether the price includes tax
- `is_product_gift_card`, where `product` is the `entity` and `gift_card` is the `dimension` 
indicating whether the product is a gift card
