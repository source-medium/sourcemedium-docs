### Overview

A dimension will always consist of an `entity` (e.g. order, customer) and a `dimension`, which is a 
qualifier that specifies a certain attribute of the `entity`. Like with metrics, the `entity` and `dimension` 
combination is the majority of what youâ€™re looking for when locating a dimension or typing a dimension in a query. 
As such, `entity` and `dimension` will always appear next to each other.

### Dimension column name formula
`{{ modifier }}_{{ entity }}_{{ dimension }}`

### Examples

- `order_index`, where `order` is the `entity` and `index` is the `dimension` that specifies the attribute of the order
- `product_variant_title`, where `product_variant` is the `entity` and `title` is the `dimension` that 
specifies the attribute of the product variant

In some cases, dimension columns will have modifiers. As with metrics, modifiers will fall before the `entity`.

### Examples with modifiers

- `primary_order_payment_gateway`, where `order` is the `entity`, `payment_gateway` is the `dimension`, and `primary` 
modifies this `entity_dimension` combination
- `most_recent_refund_date`, where `refund` is the `entity`, `date` is the `dimension`, and `most_recent` 
modifies this `entity_dimension` combination
