### Table Structure Overview
- `fct`: Each record in a fact (`fct`) table represents a unique event or transaction, characterized by metrics or measurements 
such as sales amount or units sold
- `dim`: Each record in a dimension (`dim`) table provides context for the metrics recorded in `fct` tables, such as time, geography, 
products, or customers
- `obt`: Each record in a One Big Table (`obt`) is the product of joined `fct` and `dim` tables that have been modeled into a single, unified structure
- `rpt`: Each record in a report (`rpt`) table represents a narrower, aggregated view of joined `fct` and `dim` tables that serve a specific analytical purpose


__See [Modeling Philosophy](/data-transformations/philosophy) for a more in-depth overview of the types of 
tables we generate through our data modeling.__

### Metric column name formula
- `fct` table name formula: `fct_{{ entity }}_{{ verb }}`
- `dim` table name formula: `dim_{{ dimension }}`
- `obt` table name formula: `obt_{{ entity }}`
- `rpt` table name formula: `rpt_{{ entity }}_summary_{{ aggregation_granularity }}`
