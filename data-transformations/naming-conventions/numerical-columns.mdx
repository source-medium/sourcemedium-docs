### Overview

Numerical metric columns that do not explicitly reference a count or quantity have an implied  `metric` definition in 
terms of how the data is aggregated. This convention is typically used for columns representing financial figures or other 
commonly used or accepted `metric` terminology.

### Examples

- `order_total_revenue`, where `order` is the `entity`, and `total_revenue` is the `metric` representing the total revenue generated by the order
- `customer_lifetime_value`, where `customer` is the `entity`, and `lifetime_value` is 
the `metric` representing the total value a customer brings over their lifetime

Other examples of numerical values that donâ€™t explicitly state the applied aggregation operation include:

- `clicks`
- `receives`
- `opens`
- `list_unsubscribes`
- `refunds`
- `discounts`
