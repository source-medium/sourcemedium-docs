### Overview

Numerical metric columns that do not explicitly reference a count or quantity have an implied  `metric` definition in 
terms of how the data is aggregated or what the data references specifically. This convention is typically used for columns 
representing financial figures or other commonly used or accepted metric terminology.

### Examples

- `order_total_revenue`, where `order` is the `entity`, and `total_revenue` is the `metric` representing the total revenue generated by the order
- `customer_lifetime_value`, where `customer` is the `entity`, and `lifetime_value` is 
the `metric` representing the total value a customer brings over their lifetime

Other examples of numerical values that donâ€™t explicitly state the applied aggregation operation include:

- `message_unique_clicks`
- `message_unique_receives`
- `message_unique_opens`
- `list_unsubscribes`
- `order_refunds`
- `order_discounts`
