### Overview

The prefix `sm_` in a column name indicates that the column is proprietary to SourceMedium, meaning that the data contained within is a 
function of SourceMedium's data transformations. This prefix helps to quickly identifying SourceMedium-specific fields that have been 
materially enriched through a process of cleaning or imputing.

For example, `sm_source_medium` is a field derived from last-click attribution data from Shopify, Google Analytics, GA4, Elevar, 
Blotout, Littledata, referring domains, and other sources of last-click UTM parameters.
