### Overview

A metric will always consist of an `entity` (e.g. order, customer), `dimension`, and in some cases, a `modifier`. 
To make column names more human readable, our naming conventions will always keep the `entity` and the `metric` next to each other, 
as the combination of the two represents the majority of what you’re looking for when locating a metric or typing a metric in a query. 
From there, any relevant entity modifiers will appear before the metric, as this context is critical for understanding the meaning of the 
`entity_metric` combination.

### Metric column name formula
`{{ modifier }}_{{ entity }}_{{ metric }}`

### Examples of metrics without modifiers

- `order_gross_revenue` where `order` is the `entity` and `gross_revenue` is the `metric`
- `order_net_revenue_before_refunds` where `order` is the `entity` and `net_revenue_before_refunds` is the metric

### Examples of metrics with modifiers

- `new_customer_order_net_revenue` where `order` is the `entity`, `net_order_revenue` is the `metric`, and `new_customer` modifies this `entity_metric` combination
- `repeat_customer_order_count` where `order` is the `entity`, `count` is the `metric`, and `repeat_customer` modifies this `entity_metric` combination
