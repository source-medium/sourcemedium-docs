### Overview

Time columns are designated to represent either a timestamp or a datetime value associated with an
entity and a specific dimension. The suffix \_at is used to denote a timestamp, whereas \_datetime is used
for datetime values. When a time column is localized, it will be explicitly indicated with the suffix \_local\_datetime
to denote the local time context.

### Time column name formula

`{{ entity }}_{{ dimension }}_{{ suffix }}`

### Examples

* `order_processed_at`, where `order` is the `entity`, `processed` is the `attribute`, and `_at` indicates a timestamp

* `customer_created_at_local_datetime`, where `customer` is the `entity`, `created_at` is the `dimension`,
  and `_local_datetime` indicates a localized datetime
