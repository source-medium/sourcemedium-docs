## Augmenting Your Data With Detailed Context
The next layer of our data transformation process focuses on data enrichment, which involves supplementing your 
cleaned data with additional context to maximize its utility for analytics. Because we funnel all of your data into one 
unified schema, we can leverage multiple sources to create the most complete and robust datasets possible.

Our goal is to identify, isolate, and standardize the building blocks across your data footprint and allow you to 
compose those building blocks based on your unique business needs.

__Below are some examples of how we enrich your data through our transformation layer.__

### Financial Data
The most straightforward example of how we enrich your data is by mapping financial metrics onto your transactional information (e.g. Amazon and Shopify). While 
your e-commerce and advertising platforms will report on revenue and spend, the true profitability of the customers you're acquiring remains 
a blind spot. Through our [cost configuration sheet](/data-inputs/configuration-sheet/costs/how-do-i-surface-product-costs), we integrate SKU-level 
costs into your data to enable profitability analyses.

### Channel Mapping
Channel mapping, a feature unique to the SourceMedium platform, leverages the [configuration sheet](/data-inputs/configuration-sheet/how-can-i-create-order-channels-and-subchannels) 
to enable the creation of custom groupings, termed as sub-channels. This functionality allows for a customizable and more nuanced 
examination of orders, customers, and other entities in your data.

### Last Click UTM Stitching
We ingest last-click UTM data from an array of sources, including Shopify, website analytics tools, referring domains, zero-party attribution (post-purchase surveys) 
and other event tracking optimization platforms. However, this data is rarely consistent, creating confusion and making it difficult to truly understand 
the efficacy of your advertising efforts.

To address this issue, we've developed a model that cleans, standardizes, and aggregates this data into a single table to make it much 
easier to work with (for example, to build your own multi-touch attribution analysis).

While we don't currently offer any media mix modeling solutions in-house, we simplify last-click UTM attribution reporting by using the aforementioned model and 
prioritizing the data we ingest from source-of-truth platforms closer to the actual transaction.
