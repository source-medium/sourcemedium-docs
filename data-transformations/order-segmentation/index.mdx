Order segmentation classifies each order into meaningful groups for reporting and analysis. These classifications power filters, breakdowns, and metrics throughout your dashboards.

## Key Segmentation Dimensions

## How Segmentation Works

Each segmentation dimension uses a **determination hierarchy** that evaluates multiple signals to assign the correct classification. The system prioritizes explicit signals (like platform integrations and exclusion tags) over inferred signals (like order tags and UTMs).

For example, a TikTok Shop order from a direct integration is always classified as `TikTok Shop`—even if your config sheet has a rule that would otherwise match it.

<Note>
See each dimension's page for the specific hierarchy and signal priority used.

## Customizing Segmentation

You can override default channel assignments using the **Channel Mapping** tab in your configuration sheet. This allows you to:

- Map specific UTM patterns to custom channels
- Group orders by discount codes
- Segment by order tags or SKUs
- Assign orders to vendors for cost tracking
