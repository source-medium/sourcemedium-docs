This page defines common terms you’ll see throughout SourceMedium documentation. If you’re reconciling numbers across tools, start by aligning on these definitions.

## Channel

A **channel** is a standardized classification used to group orders and performance (e.g., Online DTC, Amazon). Channel values can be influenced by configuration sheet mapping rules.

## Subchannel

A **subchannel** is a more granular breakdown under a channel (for example, different paid social strategies, affiliates, marketplaces, etc.). Subchannels are typically defined via channel mapping rules and/or UTMs.

## SourceMedium-valid order

A **SourceMedium-valid** order is an order that should be included in reporting (excluding test/invalid/voided scenarios). For order-based analyses, start with `is_order_sm_valid = TRUE`.

See: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)

## Gross revenue vs net revenue

- **Gross revenue** is typically line-level price × quantity, before discounts/refunds.
- **Net revenue** accounts for discounts/refunds and is usually the preferred basis for profitability and LTV analyses.

## Exclude $0 orders

Some accounts exclude $0 revenue orders from reporting. This can impact reconciliations and retention metrics.

## Attribution window

An **attribution window** defines how far back in time a marketing interaction can receive credit for a purchase (e.g., 7-day click, 28-day click, 120-day lookback). Different tools often use different windows.
