This page defines common terms you’ll see throughout SourceMedium documentation. If you’re reconciling numbers across tools, start by aligning on these definitions.

## Channel

A **channel** is a standardized classification used to group orders and performance (e.g., Online DTC, Amazon). Channel values can be influenced by configuration sheet mapping rules.

## Subchannel

A **subchannel** is a more granular breakdown under a channel (for example, different paid social strategies, affiliates, marketplaces, etc.). Subchannels are typically defined via channel mapping rules and/or UTMs.

## SourceMedium-valid order

A **SourceMedium-valid** order is an order that should be included in reporting (excluding test/invalid/voided scenarios). For order-based analyses, start with `is_order_sm_valid = TRUE`.

See: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)

## Gross revenue vs net revenue

- **Gross revenue** is typically line-level price × quantity, before discounts/refunds.
- **Net revenue** accounts for discounts/refunds and is usually the preferred basis for profitability and LTV analyses.

## Exclude $0 orders

Some accounts exclude $0 revenue orders from reporting. This can impact reconciliations and retention metrics.

See: [What is exclude $0 orders?](/help-center/faq/dashboard-functionality-faqs/what-is-exclude-zero-dollar-feature)

## Attribution window

An **attribution window** defines how far back in time a marketing interaction can receive credit for a purchase (e.g., 7-day click, 28-day click, 120-day lookback). Different tools often use different windows.

See: [Attribution in SourceMedium](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/attribution-in-sourcemedium)

## UTM parameters

**UTM parameters** are tracking parameters added to URLs (for example: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`) to attribute traffic and purchases to marketing campaigns.

See: [UTM Setup](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/utm-setup)

## (direct) / (none)

**`(direct) / (none)`** typically means no attributable marketing touchpoint was captured for an order (often due to missing UTMs, cross-domain/checkout breaks, or tracking blockers).

See: [Why am I seeing (direct) / (none)?](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/direct-none) and [Attribution Health](/data-inputs/attribution-health/index)

## First-party attribution

**First-party attribution** uses data you collect and control from your own properties (your site/app and checkout) to understand marketing touchpoints.

See: [First-Party Attribution](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/first-party-attribution)

## Zero-party attribution

**Zero-party attribution** uses customer-reported answers (like “How did you hear about us?”) to understand discovery channels that tracking often misses.

See: [Zero-Party Attribution](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/zero-party-attribution)
