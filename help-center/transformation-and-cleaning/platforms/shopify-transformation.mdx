- data availability
    - where is this data available in SM
        - specific table / module locations where this data lives
            - maybe accordion section for table locations (e.g. "for DDA/MDW customers, data will be surfaced to the following tables")
        - is this data used to enhance any other data?
            - e.g. GA4, Elevar, Littledata all used in UTM enrichment of orders
            - e.g. Global E enhances order level stuff
            - e.g. subscription data enhances order-level stuff, tags available on orders & customers
    - what data is available from the platform
        - maybe link out to metric & dimension documentation for given data source
        - + what default filters are we asserting
            - e.g. most marketing platforms we take attribution window set in account settings, for FB we take purely 7d Click
- default cleaning, transformations & enhancements
    - do we remove or filter anything automatically
        - e.g. we don't report on gift card revenue from Shopify
    - do we enrich this data with any other data or alter it in any way before reporting it in dashboards (before it reaches the final tables)
        - e.g. Shopify orders receive UTM enrichment from GA, Littledata, Elevar etc
- optional use cases, cleaning, transformations & enhancements
    - are there optional use cases you can enable with this data that don't come ootb
        - e.g. using discount codes from Shopify orders to populate the Influnecers Deep Dive module
    - are there any confiugrable ways that customers can transform this data
        - either by request (e.g. exclude $0 orders) or self-serve (e.g. channel mapping)
