SourceMedium is a vertical data infrastructure solution that abstracts away the business and technical complexity 
of moving, cleaning, standardizing, and preparing data so you can focus on developing actionable insights that help 
you differentiate your company.

We work with hundreds of merchants to identify their most critical analytical use cases for their businesses and develop 
data ingestion and transformation processes that streamline the journey from raw data to business decision.

To learn more about how we do this, see [Data Transformation](/data-transformations/philosophy).
