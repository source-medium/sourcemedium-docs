SourceMedium can deliver a daily metrics snapshot to Slack. Your SourceMedium team can help install and configure the bot for your account.

## What you’ll need

- Your preferred Slack channel (or a new shared channel with SourceMedium)
- Confirmation of which Shopify store(s) and brand(s) the report should cover
- The metric list you want to see (up to plan limits)

## Setup steps (high level)

1. Request Slack bot installation from your SourceMedium team in Slack or by emailing `support@sourcemedium.com`.
2. Confirm the channel where the bot should post.
3. Confirm which metrics you want included.

## Metric options
