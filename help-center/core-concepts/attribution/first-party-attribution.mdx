**First-party attribution** uses data you collect and control from your own properties (your site/app and checkout) to understand which marketing touchpoints contributed to purchases.

In practice, this typically includes **First-Party Inputs** from multiple sources:
- **Website Events**: pixel-based tracking (e.g., GA4, Elevar)
- **Server-Side Capture**: API-based tracking (e.g., Shopify Order Attributes, Connectors)
- **Landing Page Data**: Referrer and URL parameters captured at the start of the session

SourceMedium aggregates all these *First-Party Inputs* to build a complete picture.

## First-party vs platform-reported attribution

- **First-party**: derived from your site/app + checkout signals (what happened on your properties)
- **Platform-reported**: derived from ad platforms (what platforms believe happened based on their measurement and models)

Both can be useful; they often differ due to attribution windows, privacy restrictions, and identity resolution.

## What counts as a first-party signal in SourceMedium

Common examples include:

- Website analytics/event streams (e.g., GA4, Elevar)
- Landing page + referrer capture (including UTMs when present)
- Checkout/order-level capture for UTMs (useful when browser tracking drops parameters)

## Where first-party attribution shows up in SourceMedium

- **Last-click attribution (UTM-based)**: relies on UTMs/landing/referrer capture to assign the most recent touchpoint.
- **Multi-touch attribution (MTA)**: uses first-party purchase journeys (touchpoints) to model first touch, last touch, and linear attribution across the journey.

## Common failure modes (and how to reduce them)

- **`(direct) / (none)` growth**: usually missing UTMs or UTMs being dropped during the journey (cross-domain/checkout).
- **Cross-domain/checkout breaks**: customers move between domains or checkout flows and attribution context is lost.
- **Browser/privacy restrictions**: ad blockers, iOS privacy features, and browser changes reduce client-side tracking reliability.

<Tip>
Start with consistent UTM setup, then ensure you are capturing data across both client-side (pixel) and server-side (API) inputs to maximize coverage.
