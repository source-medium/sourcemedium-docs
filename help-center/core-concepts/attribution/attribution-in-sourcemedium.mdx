SourceMedium supports multiple attribution approaches. This guide explains what we mean by attribution, where it comes from, and which knobs typically cause differences between tools.

## Two common attribution layers

### Last-click attribution (UTM-based)

Last-click attribution assigns credit to the **most recent** tracked marketing touch before a purchase.

- Primary inputs: UTM parameters, landing pages, referrers
- Common use: channel reporting, performance trends, and reconciliation to analytics tools

- [Attribution Source Hierarchy](/data-transformations/attribution-source-hierarchy) - How we prioritize between data sources

### Multi-touch attribution (MTA)

Multi-touch attribution assigns credit across multiple touch points within a lookback window.

- Primary inputs: first-party event streams (e.g., GA4), marketing data, and modeled purchase journeys
- Common use: understanding incremental contribution across channels, creatives, and landing pages

- [MTA FAQs](/mta/mta-faqs)

### Zero-party attribution (survey-based)

Zero-party attribution uses **customer-reported** survey answers (for example: “How did you hear about us?”) to understand top-of-funnel discovery that tracking often misses.

- [Zero-party attribution](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/zero-party-attribution)
- [Survey best practices (HDYHAU)](/help-center/faq/account-management-faqs/best-practices-in-setting-up-a-post-purchase-hdyhau-survey)

## Common reasons attribution differs between tools

- Different lookback windows (e.g., 7-day vs 28-day vs 120-day)
- Missing or inconsistent UTMs (especially for email/SMS and paid social)
- Cross-domain or checkout tracking limitations
- Post-purchase edits or delayed revenue recognition
