**Zero-party attribution** is attribution based on what customers explicitly tell you—most commonly via a post-purchase survey like **"How did you hear about us?" (HDYHAU)**.

<Note>
The term "zero-party data" was coined by [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/straight-from-the-source-collecting-zero-party-data-from-customers/): *"data that a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand, including preference center data, purchase intentions, and personal context."*
</Note>

This distinction is important: 
- **First-party data** is data you collect about a user's behavior (observed intent - e.g., "User viewed Blue Shirt").
- **Zero-party data** is data the user tells you about themselves (explicit intent - e.g., "I am looking for a Blue Shirt").

This complements tracking-based attribution by capturing discovery channels that are often hard to measure with cookies and pixels. As privacy restrictions reduce tracking reliability, zero-party data becomes increasingly valuable.

## When zero-party attribution is most useful

Zero-party data is especially valuable for:

- Word of mouth / referrals
- Podcasts, radio, print, and other offline media
- Influencers where click tracking is inconsistent
- PR and partnerships

## How it fits with UTMs and MTA

A simple way to think about the three layers:

1. **Zero-party**: “How did you first hear about us?” (discovery/awareness)
2. **UTM last-click**: the last tracked touch before purchase (conversion)
3. **MTA**: credit across multiple touchpoints in the journey (multi-touch)

<Tip>
If surveys show meaningful revenue from a channel that tracking doesn’t capture, treat that as a measurement gap to investigate—not just a reporting difference.
</Tip>

## Survey setup basics (high impact)

- Prefer **single-select** answers for clean reporting, with an optional free-text “Other”.
- Keep options mutually exclusive (avoid overlapping choices like “Instagram” and “Social”).
- Use stable naming for options so historical reporting stays consistent.
