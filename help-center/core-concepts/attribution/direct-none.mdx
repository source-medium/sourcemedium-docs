In attribution reporting, **`(direct) / (none)`** typically means SourceMedium could not confidently associate an order with a marketing touchpoint (for example, missing UTMs or lost attribution context during the journey).

## Common causes

1. **Missing UTMs**: Campaigns (especially email/SMS and paid social) aren't consistently tagged.
2. **UTMs dropped during the journey**: Cross-domain transitions, checkout flows, or redirects (including URL shorteners and 302s) lose parameters.
3. **"Dark social" and mobile apps**: Links shared via WhatsApp, Slack, SMS, or clicked within mobile apps often don't pass referrer data.
4. **Offline documents**: Links embedded in PDFs, Word/Excel/PowerPoint files, or slide decks have no referrer context.
5. **HTTPS to HTTP transitions**: Navigating from a secure site to a non-secure page drops referral data for security.
6. **Tracking blockers**: Ad blockers, iOS privacy restrictions, browser privacy modes, and firewall settings reduce client-side capture.
7. **Bookmarks and direct URL entry**: Returning customers who bookmarked your site or type the URL directly.
8. **Long time-to-convert**: The purchase happens after attribution context expires or can't be stitched.

## How to diagnose (fast)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if your links are tagged">
    Pick a few live campaigns and click through. Confirm the landing page URL includes `utm_source` / `utm_medium` / `utm_campaign`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find where UTMs are being lost">
    If the landing page has UTMs but orders still show `(direct) / (none)`, the drop often happens during cross-domain navigation or checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look for the pattern by channel">
    If `(direct) / (none)` spikes after a specific campaign type (email/SMS, paid social, affiliates), that’s usually the tagging or redirect path for that channel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate against survey data">
    If surveys show meaningful discovery but tracking shows `(direct) / (none)`, that’s a strong signal you have a capture gap.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to reduce (direct) / (none)

- Standardize UTM tagging across all channels (start here: [UTM Setup](/help-center/core-concepts/attribution/utm-setup))
- Add server-side/checkout capture for platforms where UTMs are commonly dropped (Shopify Plus teams often capture UTMs into order attributes)
- Use post-purchase surveys to supplement tracking-based attribution for offline and hard-to-track channels
