SourceMedium’s transformed dataset is designed to be a **central source of truth for your customers**—with stable join keys and normalized tables that make it easier to:
- Build a customer 360 (orders, products, geo, acquisition context)
- Attach enrichment fields (zero-party, first-party, or third-party)
- Create audience-ready customer lists (while respecting privacy requirements)

## What “customer record enrichment” means in practice

Most enrichment work comes down to two steps:
1. **Pick a customer-level join key** (usually `sm_customer_key`)
2. **Attach attributes** you want to analyze (or activate) at the customer level

In SourceMedium, `your_project.sm_transformed_v2.dim_customers` is the base customer table, and most downstream analysis joins back through `sm_customer_key`.

## Common enrichment sources

### Zero-party (self-reported)

Collected directly from customers (post-purchase surveys, quizzes, account creation). This is typically the highest-quality demographic data you can get—because it’s explicit.

### First-party (internal systems you control)

Attributes you collect operationally (loyalty tier, VIP status, subscription preferences, customer tags) that can flow into the warehouse via customer/order tags or platform fields.

### Third-party enrichment

Purchased demographic/household attributes joined to your customer records via privacy-safe identifiers (often hashed email) or address/phone, depending on the vendor.

### Inference (use cautiously)

Heuristic enrichment derived from PII (for example, gender inference from first name). Useful for directional analysis, not ground truth.

## Audience building workflows (warehouse-first)

Once attributes are on a customer-level table, you can build segments like:
- High LTV customers in a specific region
- New customers acquired from a specific campaign strategy
- Customers who match a survey persona

Those segments can then be exported from your warehouse (commonly using hashed identifiers like `customer_email_hashed`) for downstream activation—if your policies and tools allow.

### Strategy-based “audience” segments via campaign/UTM conventions

If you run demographic-targeted (or persona-targeted) campaigns, the most reliable way to measure **long-term LTV** is to encode the targeting strategy into a joinable attribute at purchase time—typically UTMs.

For example:
- Create distinct ad sets per segment
- Add a stable segment label to `utm_campaign` / `utm_content` / `utm_term`
- Analyze LTV by that label in the warehouse

This produces “LTV by targeting strategy” (joinable to customers/orders), which is usually more actionable than ad-platform demographic breakdowns.

<Warning>
Be careful with PII and inferred demographic attributes. Ensure your privacy policy, consent practices, and downstream usage are compliant with applicable laws and platform policies.
</Warning>

## Start here: demographics and joinability

The most common question is demographics (age/gender) and whether ad platforms can provide it in a way that supports LTV.
