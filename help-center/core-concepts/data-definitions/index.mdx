These pages document the **definitions that matter** across SourceMedium:

- The business rules behind how we normalize, map, and dedupe data
- The “gotchas” that most often cause analysis to drift

If you’re here for SQL examples, the fastest starting point is the [SQL Query Library](/data-activation/template-resources/sql-query-library).
