SourceMedium exposes multiple revenue fields because “revenue” can mean different things depending on the question you’re answering.

This page focuses on the **order-level** revenue fields you’ll see most often in:
- `your_project.sm_transformed_v2.obt_orders`
- `your_project.sm_transformed_v2.rpt_executive_summary_daily`
- Many [SQL Query Library](/data-activation/template-resources/sql-query-library) recipes

## Key fields (order-level)

These are the canonical order-level fields in `obt_orders`:
- `order_gross_revenue`: line-item revenue before discounts, excluding gift card purchases
- `order_discounts`: discounts applied (see sign convention below)
- `order_refunds`: refunds applied (see sign convention below)
- `order_net_revenue`: gross revenue after discounts and refunds
- `order_net_revenue_before_refunds`: gross revenue after discounts, before refunds
- `order_total_revenue`: net revenue with shipping and taxes included (after discounts/refunds)

## Important sign convention (discounts + refunds)

In most SourceMedium tables, **discounts and refunds are stored as negative numbers** (or `0`).

That means net revenue is additive:

```sql
-- Conceptual relationship
order_net_revenue = order_gross_revenue + order_discounts + order_refunds
```

<Note>
If you see positive refunds in your data, treat it as a data-quality edge case (some platforms can emit adjustments that violate the expected sign conventions).
</Note>

## Quick sanity-check query

```sql
SELECT
  sm_store_id,
  SUM(order_gross_revenue) AS gross_revenue,
  SUM(order_discounts) AS discounts,
  SUM(order_refunds) AS refunds,
  SUM(order_net_revenue) AS net_revenue,
  SUM(order_net_revenue_before_refunds) AS net_revenue_before_refunds,
  SUM(order_total_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM `your_project.sm_transformed_v2.obt_orders`
WHERE is_order_sm_valid = TRUE
  AND order_processed_at_local_datetime >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY net_revenue DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
