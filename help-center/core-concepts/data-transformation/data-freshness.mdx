Most data in your SourceMedium Dashboard or Managed Warehouse is **fresh to the previous day** -- meaning, when looking at your dashboard or querying your 
warehouse, you will have access to all of yesterday's data & prior.  

Changes made to your Configuration Sheet are picked up by our data model & pushed to your dashboard and/or warehouse every 30 minutes.

<Accordion title="Data that will not always be fresh to the previous day:">
- Amazon Seller & Vendor Central, and Amazon Ads (& DSP) data
    - Due to Amazon API rate limits, data can take anywhere from 24-72 hours to make it to your dashboard / warehouse
