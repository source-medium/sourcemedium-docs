### Cleaning vs Transformation (vs Enrichment)

At a high-level, cleaning focuses on the quality of the data, transformation focuses on the usability & efficiency, and enrichment focuses on data completeness.

**Data cleaning** is the process of removing data that does not belong in a dataset (e.g. duplicate, corrupted, or unnecessary data) and 
standardizing the remaining data (e.g. you might see values of `Null`, `NA`, `Not Applicable`, and ` ` that all mean the same thing).  This is a crucial step for 
ensuring that decisions are being made on complete & accurate data, especially when analyzing data from more than one source.

**Data transformation** is the process of converting data from one format to another for the purposes of warehousing and analysis.  The whole purpose of transforming 
data is to make it easier for computers & end-users to work with!

**Data enrichment** falls somewhere in the middle of cleaning and transformation.  Enrichment is the process of enhancing collected data with relevant context (more 
data) obtained from additional trusted sources.  One outcome of this enrichment process is in SourceMedium is our ability to place 30% more UTM coverage than Google Analytics 4 alone.
