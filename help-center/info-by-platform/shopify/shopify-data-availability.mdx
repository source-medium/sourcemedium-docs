### What `{Platform}` data is available in Source Medium?
**Overview & how this data is used in Source Medium**

You could say Shopify is our bread and butter, it's where the journey of Source Medium started (checkout our 
free Slackbot, and read more about our roots here).  As one of the largest & most trusted ecomm platforms on the market, we consider Shopify data to be 
source-of-truth for a large majority of sales & revenue use cases, and Shopify data is used widely throughout the Source Medium platform.

Source Medium ingests & aggregates data points from across numurous Shopify tables spanning customer, order, line-item, 
and fulfillment performance (just to name a few)!  We aggregate relevant metadata points and tie them back to 
the customers/orders/line-item sales that are driving performance to build a more holistic picture of what you're selling, 
who you're selling to, and where they're coming from.  

In our ecosystem, Shopify data is often enriched with metadata from additional 
integrations: Google Analytics/Elevar/Littledata etc. for attribution enrichment, ReCharge/StayAI etc. for additional subscription insights, 
and more (you can find our full list of supported integrations & data enrichment tools [here](/data-inputs/)).
