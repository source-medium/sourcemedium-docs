        - is this data used to enhance any other data?
            - e.g. GA4, Elevar, Littledata all used in UTM enrichment of orders
            - e.g. Global E enhances order level stuff
            - e.g. subscription data enhances order-level stuff, tags available on orders & customers
    - what data is available from the platform
        - maybe link out to metric & dimension documentation for given data source
        - + what default filters are we asserting
            - e.g. most marketing platforms we take attribution window set in account settings, for FB we take purely 7d Click
