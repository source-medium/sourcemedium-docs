It is sourced from your Amazon marketing connections as well as any additional spend attributed to Amazon in the Cost tab of your Configuration Sheet ([find out how to do so here](https://help.sourcemedium.com/articles/how-do-i-include-marketing-spend-through-the-cost-tab-of-the-configuration-sheet)).

### Things to Note

1. After connecting us to your marketing accounts, we will integrate your marketing information to our data models. Due to Amazon's imposed API limitations, historic Ads and DSP data is limited to 60 days before the initial ingestion. <br />**The sooner you connect us to your Amazon Ads and DSP data, the more historic data will be available and stored in your dashboard.**
2. We guarantee data freshness to 72 hours before the present, but it is typically fresh to 48 hours.
3. We are currently using "total purchases" as the metric for conversions, with a 14 day window for DSP.
