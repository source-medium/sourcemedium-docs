SourceMedium Executive Summary reports on the discrete order date, with any subsequent modifications to the order reflecting back on the original order date.

Shopify reports on the event date, with any subsequent modifications to the order reflecting on the date of the event/modification date, this is referred to as Transaction Based reporting.

Due to the difference in reporting, gross revenue in the SourceMedium Executive Summary may not align perfectly with the respective Shopify sales report.
