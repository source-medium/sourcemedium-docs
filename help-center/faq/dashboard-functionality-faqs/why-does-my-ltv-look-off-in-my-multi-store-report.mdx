**Environmental factors:** Multiple Shopify stores

### Resolution ###
For LTV and Retention reports, make sure you only have one brand selected in the Brand ID filter. Currently, we do not support cross-brand holistic LTV (e.g. combining multiple stores at the same time and looking at the LTV).  LTV needs to be viewed on a per-store basis.
