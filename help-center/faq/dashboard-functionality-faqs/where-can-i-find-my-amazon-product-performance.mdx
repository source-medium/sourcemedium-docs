### Notes

#### ASIN vs SKU
    
**ASIN** and **SKU** are two different identifiers used on the Amazon platform to uniquely identify products, but they serve different purposes.
    
    - **ASIN** stands for Amazon Standard Identification Number. It is a unique identifier assigned by Amazon to each product listed on their platform. ASINs are used to identify and differentiate individual product variations, such as color, size, and edition, within a product listing. ASINs are permanent and do not change, even if the product is sold by multiple sellers.
    - On the other hand, **SKU** stands for Stock Keeping Unit. It is a unique identifier assigned by sellers to track and manage their inventory. SKUs are internal codes that sellers use to manage their inventory, fulfill orders, and track sales and profitability. Unlike ASINs, SKUs are specific to individual sellers and can differ across different sellers who are selling the same product on Amazon. Sellers can assign their own SKU codes based on their internal inventory management system or business processes.
        
     ***We do have SKU information but we do not have ASIN data at this time.***       

#### Refunds
    
    Refunds could be lagged by at least one week due to the factors of variables such as shipping times, customer-reported refund times and amazon reporting times.
