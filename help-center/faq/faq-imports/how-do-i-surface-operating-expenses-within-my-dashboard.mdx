### Requirements

Inserted **operating expenses** on the **Financial Cost - Operating Expenses** tab on the configuration sheet

### Background

Keeping track of `Operating Expenses` is crucial for your business. It is a significant expense that directly affects your profitability.

### Steps

1. Input your **Operating Expenses** within your **Configuration Sheet**
    1. Go to the **Financial Cost - Operating Expenses** Tab 
    2. Enter the below: 
        - category = Financial
        - channel (e.g. Online DTC, Amazon, Retail) 
        - expense_channel = Operating Expenses
        - region - *If the region you want to add is not a part of the drop down, please let the team know and we will add it.*
        - fixed cost - *These are your monthly operating expenses*
        - date_start
        - date_end <br />
        
    *Notes: The costs must be entered by month.* 
        
    `Date_start` *and* `date_end` *can be used to capture changes in operating expenses over time. You will be able to change these date fields historically and in the future in case of updates to operating expenses and our data model will update accordingly.*
    
    *It is imperative to make sure you include a date_end date as the row will not be included if there is not date_end included.*
