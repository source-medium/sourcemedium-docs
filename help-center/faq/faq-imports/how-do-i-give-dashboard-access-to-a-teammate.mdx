### Background

Your team can provision dashboard access at any plan-level.

### **Steps**

1. Inviting team members to access SourceMedium
    1. Invite team members to access SourceMedium anytime using the **Access Group link** found in your **shared slack channel** > **pinned threads** section.
    2. If you have not setup a shared slack channel, please email **[support@sourcemedium.com](mailto:support@sourcemedium.com)** to receive instructions for your Access Group link
    3. Anyone added to this group will be able to view your SourceMedium dashboards, so we recommend monitoring who you add
2. Anyone with **Manager** status in the group can provision access
    - *If you receive an error message when directly adding someone to the group, see [here](https://support.google.com/groups/thread/65665236/person-has-turned-off-the-setting-to-be-directly-added-to-the-group-how-do-i-fix-this?hl=en) to help troubleshoot*
3. If you receive an error message when trying to access the group, make sure that you are logged into the correct email address that has been added to the Access Group
