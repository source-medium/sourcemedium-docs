### Best practices in setting up a “How Did You Hear About Us?” survey to collect zero-party data

### Survey Setup

The main copy used and the options selected should be specific for your brand and respective marketing channels. Different platforms offer different ways to set up questions, but these are the general options we recommend.

**Title**: How did you first hear about us?

**Introduction text**: [leave blank]

**Placeholder text**: choose an option

**Button text**: submit

<Accordion title="Standard response options:">
- Facebook
- Instagram
- TikTok
- Google (or other search engine)
- Youtube
- Podcast
- Blog or press
- Influencer
- Friend - family - coworker
- Other
</Accordion>

<Accordion title = "Other channels to consider [not necessary if small spend]:"> 
- Pinterest
- Snapchat
- Bing Search
- Google (or other search engine) 
    - Can be broken into two or more questions depending on the platforms you're looking to track.
</Accordion>

### Recommended Survey/Question Settings

- Display the options in random order, if possible.
- Add a “fake” response option for a marketing channel that you aren't currently using (e.g. TV)
- Optional: Select Only **capture one response per customer.**
- Optional: Enable free form “Other” option if you would like richer qualitative response data

### Customer and Order Tagging

- Enable customer and order level tagging (note, for some platforms this is an upsell feature for a more premium plan)
- Label with the prefix **HDYHAU-** or **PPS-**
    - This label will be easier to identify for filtering in the SourceMedium dashboard and will show as something like **HDYHAU-Facebook**

### Where can zero party data be used in the SourceMedium dashboard?

- New Customers - customer tag required
- Last Order Analysis - customer tag required
