Gift card revenue is not counted towards revenue because revenue from gift cards is considered deferred revenue. To analyze gift card revenue you can use the `Payment Gateway` filter on the Orders Deep Dive module. Revenue from gift cards will be tracked when the gift cards are spent. 

**Additional Note:** First-time orders which include only gift cards are not counted as new customers by Shopify, but will be counted as new customers by Source Medium.
