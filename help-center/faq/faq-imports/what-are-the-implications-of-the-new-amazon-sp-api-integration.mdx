### Background

Amazon deprecated their MWS reporting API and transitioned to SP (Selling Partner) APIs in July 2022. We are supporting a free BETA integration for this new connection with current Pro Plan customers, with plans to incorporate Amazon sales as part of the pricing model by the beginning of Q1 2023.

### What is the benefit of integrating Amazon data into the dashboard?

- Increase your omni-channel awareness by blending Amazon sales into your Executive Summary
- Determine and compare Amazon acquisition performance (when [Amazon Ads](https://help.sourcemedium.com/articles/connect-amazon-ads-data-to-source-medium-dashboards) also integrated)

### What Amazon data will surface in the dashboard?
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Metrics:">
- `Orders`
- `Gross Revenue` (called 'Ordered Product Sales' in Amazon Business Reports)
    - This feeds into `Net Revenue` and `Total Revenue` in the dashboard
- `Discounts`
- `Refunds`
- `Shipping`
- `Gross Quantity`
    - This feeds into `Net Quantity`  and `Cart Size`
</ Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dimensions:">
- `Date`
- `Product Titles`
- `SKUs`
</ Accordion>
</ AccordionGroup>



### Where will this surface in the dashboard?

- Executive Summary
- YoY Performance
- Orders Deep Dive
- Product Performance

*(Note: Make sure to select `Amazon` in the channel selector)*

### What features are currently under development?

- `New / Repeat Customers`
- `Order Sequence / Index`
- `LTV/Retention` *(Note: this will be limited to customers who purchase exclusively on Amazon)*

### Is customer-level data available?


- Amazon does not provide any PII at the customer-level at the moment
- Any charts using the following dimensions / metrics will not be compatible with Amazon data
    - `CPA` (however, if your Amazon Ads account is integrated in the dashboard then `CPO` will be available)
    - `Acquisition Channels` (including `Source / Medium`)
    - `Discount Codes`

### Is subscription-level data available?

This is not available from Amazon via API at this time

### How fresh is the data?

Amazon applies API rate limits, so data will generally be fresh up to the previous 48 hours

### What historical data is available?

Data ingestion will go back to 1 year before the date that SourceMedium received Seller Central permissions and the API connectors were created
    - This requires additional requests to the APIs, and due to rate limits, may take up to 14 days to complete
    - We are working on solution(s) to include historical data that goes further back than 1 year, although this data may be limited in some instances
