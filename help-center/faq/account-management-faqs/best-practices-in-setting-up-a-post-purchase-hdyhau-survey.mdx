## What is a HDYHAU Survey?

A "How Did You Hear About Us?" (HDYHAU) survey collects **zero-party data**—information customers voluntarily provide about how they discovered your brand. This data is valuable because:

- **Privacy-resistant**: Not affected by cookie blockers, iOS privacy features, or ad blockers
- **Top-of-funnel visibility**: Captures awareness channels that tracking can't see (word of mouth, podcasts, TV)
- **Validates tracking data**: Cross-reference with your analytics to identify attribution gaps

<Info>
Zero-party data complements (not replaces) your tracking-based attribution. Use both for a complete picture of your marketing performance.
</Info>

## Survey Placement & Timing

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Thank-You Page (Recommended)">
    Display the survey immediately after purchase on the order confirmation/thank-you page.

    **Pros:**
    - Highest response rates (15-30%)
    - Customer is already engaged
    - Memory is fresh

    **Cons:**
    - Can slow checkout flow slightly
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Post-Purchase Email">
    Send survey via email after order confirmation.

    **Pros:**
    - Doesn't interrupt checkout
    - Can include follow-up questions

    **Cons:**
    - Lower response rates (3-8%)
    - Delay may affect memory accuracy
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
For optimal response rates, display the survey on the thank-you page. Most survey tools (Fairing, KnoCommerce, Zigpoll) support this placement out of the box.
</Tip>

## Survey Setup

### Question Copy

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Question** | "How did you first hear about us?" |
| **Introduction text** | Leave blank (keep it short) |
| **Placeholder text** | "Choose an option" |
| **Button text** | "Submit" |

<Note>
The word **"first"** is important—it prompts customers to think about initial discovery, not their most recent interaction.
</Note>

### Standard Response Options

Include channels where you actively market. Order matters for accurate data:

<Accordion title="Recommended response options">
- Facebook / Meta
- Instagram
- TikTok
- Google Search
- YouTube
- Podcast
- Blog / Press / Article
- Influencer / Creator
- Email / Newsletter
- Friend / Family / Coworker
- I don't remember
- Other
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Additional channels to consider">
Add these if you have meaningful spend or presence:

- Pinterest
- Snapchat
- Streaming TV / CTV
- Linear TV
- Radio
- Billboard / Out of Home
- Direct Mail
- Reddit
- Twitter / X
- LinkedIn (B2B)
- Bing Search
</Accordion>

<Warning>
**Always include "I don't remember"** as an option. Without it, customers who genuinely don't recall will select a random channel, polluting your data. Research shows 10-20% of respondents legitimately don't remember.
</Warning>

## Survey Settings & Best Practices

### Response Order

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Randomize Options" icon="shuffle">
    Randomize the display order of channels to prevent position bias (first options get selected more often).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pin Bottom Options" icon="thumbtack">
    Keep "I don't remember" and "Other" pinned at the bottom—these should always be last.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Control Option (Validation Check)

Add a "control" channel you **don't** use to detect random clicking:

```
Example: If you don't advertise on TV, include "TV Commercial" as an option.
```

If this control option receives significant responses (>5%), it indicates:
- Customers are clicking randomly
- Your question may be confusing
- Response data quality may be compromised

<Tip>
A well-designed survey should see <3% responses for the control option.
</Tip>

### Response Settings

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Responses per customer** | One response only (prevents duplicate data) |
| **Free-form "Other"** | Enable—captures channels you haven't listed |
| **Required vs Optional** | Optional (required surveys reduce completion rates) |

---

## Improving Response Rates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep it short">
    One question is ideal. Each additional question reduces completion by ~20%.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mobile-friendly design">
    Ensure options are tap-friendly on mobile (most Shopify traffic is mobile).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visual design">
    Match your brand's look and feel. A cohesive design feels less intrusive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider incentives">
    Some brands offer discount codes for survey completion (use sparingly—can bias responses).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customer & Order Tagging

Enable tagging so responses flow into SourceMedium and your other analytics tools.

### Tag Format

Use a consistent prefix for easy filtering:

| Prefix | Example Tag |
|--------|-------------|
| `HDYHAU-` | `HDYHAU-Facebook` |
| `PPS-` | `PPS-TikTok` |
| `survey-` | `survey-Podcast` |

<Note>
Most survey platforms (Fairing, KnoCommerce, Zigpoll) support both **customer tags** and **order tags**. Enable both for maximum flexibility in reporting.
</Note>

### Platform-Specific Setup

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fairing" icon="chart-simple" href="/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/fairing-integration">
    Enterprise-grade surveys with advanced targeting and A/B testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="KnoCommerce" icon="chart-pie" href="/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/knocommerce-integration">
    Zero-party data platform with multi-question flows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zigpoll" icon="square-poll-horizontal">
    Lightweight surveys with Shopify-native integration.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using Survey Data in SourceMedium

Once tagging is configured, HDYHAU data appears in these modules:

| Module | Tag Type Required |
|--------|-------------------|
| **New Customers Analysis** | Customer tag |
| **Last Order Analysis** | Customer tag |
| **Orders Deep Dive** | Order tag |
| **Post-Purchase Survey Module** | Order tag |

<Info>
The Post-Purchase Survey Module provides dedicated reporting for zero-party data. Contact the SourceMedium team for access.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing 'I don't remember' option">
    Forces customers to guess, corrupting your data. Always include this option.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Too many options">
    More than 12-15 options overwhelms customers. Group similar channels (e.g., "Social Media" instead of listing every platform).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-randomized order">
    First options receive disproportionate clicks. Randomize to get accurate distribution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Asking about last touchpoint">
    "How did you hear about us?" captures discovery. For last touchpoint, use "What brought you back today?"—but this is usually better captured via tracking.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
