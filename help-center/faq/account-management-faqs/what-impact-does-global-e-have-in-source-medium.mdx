Here is important information regarding how some metrics are calculated if you use Global-E within your Shopify. 

**Gross Revenue:**

- Deducts duties

**Total Taxes:** 

- Adds duties

**Subtotal Tax:** 

- Adds duties

**Example:** 

| Metric | Without SourceMedium (Shopify Sales Report) | With SourceMedium |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross Revenue | \$12 (\$10 gross sales + \$2 duties)  | \$10 (-\$2 duties) |
| Total Taxes | \$3.50 ($3 tax +\$.50 refund taxes) |\$5.5 ($3 tax +\$.50 refund taxes +\$2 duties) |
| Subtotal Tax  | \$3 | \$5 (\$3 tax +\$2 duties) |

Because of how these are calculated within **gross revenue** and **total tax**, it will also impact the **net revenue**, **net revenue before refunds** and **total revenue** of your Online DTC channel.

- **Net Revenue** = Gross Revenue - Discounts - Refunds - Duties
- **Net Revenue Before Refunds** = Gross Revenue - Discounts - Duties
- **Total Revenue** = Net Revenue + Shipping + Taxes + Duties

All of these revenue figures, post duties being subtracted, are reflected within your Executive Summary and Orders level data (Orders Deep Dive).

*These revenue figures will not be reflected on your Product Performance level data.* 

We hope this information clarifies how Global-E affects the calculation of various metrics and provides you with a better understanding of the impact it has within SourceMedium.
