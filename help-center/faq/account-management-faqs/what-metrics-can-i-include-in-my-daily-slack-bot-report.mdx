## Follow this guide for configuring your daily Slack Bot report

### Requirements

• Paid **Pro** or **Enterprise** Plan on SourceMedium

• [**Slack bot properly installed for your Shopify store(s)**](/help-center/what-is-sourcemediumarticles/source-medium-report-analytics-slack-bot-setup)

• Directly connected subscription platform to SourceMedium (if a subscription based store)

### Steps

1. The following will be the default metrics shown:
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title= "For 'non-subscription' based stores">
    ◦ net_revenue

    ◦ orders    

    ◦ aov    

    ◦ spend

    ◦ cpa

    ◦ roas

    ◦ cvr

    ◦ customers_new

    ◦ customers_repeat
     </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title= "For 'subscription' based stores these additional metrics will be added to the above by default">
    ◦ subscriptions_new
    
    ◦subscriptions_cancelled
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>


2. For non-defaulted metrics, this daily slack report can be customized with up to 10 of the metrics that can be found on the 'Executive Summary' dashboard ([see here](https://airtable.com/shrVwL4GTM4WJ93h8/tblkfb5z544UzFuZT)). Just reach out to a CSA and let them know what you'd like to see!
