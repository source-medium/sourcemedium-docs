It’s common for subscription reporting to differ across tools. ReCharge and SourceMedium may be answering slightly different questions, using different timestamps, or applying different rules for refunds, cancellations, and attribution.

## Start by aligning on definitions

Before troubleshooting, confirm which definition you’re using in each tool:

- **New subscriptions:** created date vs first successful charge vs first fulfilled order
- **Cancelled subscriptions:** cancelled timestamp vs churn proxy (no recurring orders in X days)
- **Subscription order revenue:** gross vs net revenue, and how refunds are handled

## Common causes of mismatches

### 1) Different time fields

ReCharge often reports on subscription lifecycle timestamps, while SourceMedium reporting typically uses order-based timestamps (e.g., processed/created at) for revenue and order metrics.

### 2) Refund and cancellation handling

If an order is refunded or cancelled, different tools may:

- Exclude it entirely
- Include it in gross but not net
- Attribute it to the original purchase date vs the refund date

### 3) Attribution differences (UTM + checkout)

Subscription checkouts can reduce UTM coverage depending on your storefront/checkout setup. If you’re validating “source/medium” or channel attribution, start with:

- [Improving Your Last-Click (UTM) Attribution](/data-inputs/platform-supporting-resources/ga4/improving-last-click-attribution)
- [Google Analytics common failures](/data-inputs/platform-supporting-resources/ga4/google-analytics-common-failures)

### 4) Multi-store / multi-channel scoping

Confirm you’re comparing the same store(s), channel(s), and date range in both tools.

## What to do next

If you’re still seeing unexplained differences, share the following with your SourceMedium team:

- The ReCharge report you’re using (name + filters + date field)
- The SourceMedium module/table you’re comparing against
- A handful of example subscription IDs or order IDs that illustrate the mismatch
