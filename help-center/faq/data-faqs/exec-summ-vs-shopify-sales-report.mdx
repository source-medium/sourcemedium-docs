title: "Why isn't my revenue in the Executive Summary matching with Shopify's Sales Report?"
description: "Common causes for Executive Summary and Shopify Sales Report mismatches including exclude $0 orders and channel mapping rules"
---

The Executive Summary is designed to mirror the accounting rules present in the Shopify Sales Report, and will almost always 
match 1:1.  However, there are some instances where you won't see a 1:1 match:

1. If your brand has our `Exclude $0 Orders` feature enabled, you will see a revenue and orders mismatch.  This feature excludes 
orders with a total revenue of $0 from all Executive Summary and Retention dashboard data.  If you're unsure if you have this 
feature enabled, reach out to our Support team in Slack or via email at support@sourcemedium.com.  See here for a deeper explanation of this feature

2. If your brand has any data cleaning rules in the Channel Mapping tab your Configuration Sheet-- e.g. any rules routing orders 
to a channel other than Online DTC -- you will see a mismatch if only Online DTC is selected in the channel dropdown (located at 
the top right-hand corner of your report, under the date range filter).

If you are running sales through Amazon, be sure to deselect "Amazon" in the channel dropdown when comparing sales data between 
the Executive Summary and Shopify Sales report
