For all marketing platforms, SourceMedium will report on the attribution window set within your ad platform.  

For example, if you haven't changed your Snapchat Ads attribution window, we will use the default 28-day click, 1-day view window. If you update your Snapchat configuration to a different attribution window, we will report on the new window.  For Meta, SourceMedium will report based on an account-level default of 7-day click, 1-day view.
