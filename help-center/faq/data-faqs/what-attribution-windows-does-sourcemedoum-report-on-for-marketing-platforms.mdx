**For Meta/Facebook Ads we report strictly on 7 day click attribution.**

For all other platforms, SourceMedium will report on the attribution window set within your ad platform.  For example, If you haven't changed your Snapchat Ads attribution window, we will use the default 28-day click, 1-day view window. If you update your Snapchat configuration to a different attribution window, we will report on the new window.
