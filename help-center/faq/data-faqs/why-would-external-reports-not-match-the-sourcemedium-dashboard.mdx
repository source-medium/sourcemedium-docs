*Note: Most modules in your SourceMedium dashboard allow for a change in time granularity (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) and can be altered at your request. We do not provide custom time calculations at this time (i.e. fiscal, rolling weeks, etc).*
### How to check SourceMedium dashboard data accuracy ###
If your data doesn't match or seems inaccurate against external sources, such as an agency or another reporting software, please take time to consider the common discrepancies below:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Shopify Reports">
If you have requested to `exclude $0 net revenue orders` then your gross revenue, total revenue, discounts, and refunds will not match Shopify numbers

Also, ensure you're selecting all Shopify-related Channels in your dashboard 
- some orders may be moved to other Channels due to Channel Mapping rules your team has in place
- some orders are automatically moved to other Channels based on metadata attached to orders 
    - e.g. Wholesale, Draft Orders etc

*Non-U.S. store specific*: If your store settings are set `taxes included` then revenue may be off. You can work with our dev team to align this correctly in our data model

*Additional information on matching the Shopify Sales Report can be found [here.](/help-center/faq/data-faqs/why-dont-the-executive-summary-and-shopifys-sales-report-match)*
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Meta Ads Reports">
Check to ensure you're looking at the default attribution window assigned to each campaign within the Meta UI.  SourceMedium reports based on the default window set to each campaign, which could vary between your different campaigns.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Google Ads Reports">
Check using the attribution window set in your account and only count *purchase* conversions and revenue. This is the default for all SourceMedium customers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Minor discrepancies with recent marketing data (eg past 7 days)">
Often caused by Facebook or Google dynamically taking credit for purchases happening within the day using the attribution window set in the account. These numbers are reconciled daily at 1:00 AM PST, when data is ingested to SourceMedium.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
SourceMedium is Source of Truth reporting, which means the data that is surfaced is pulled raw from the data source/platform, transformed, and then provided for the BI layer (Looker Studio dashboard, or BYOBI)
