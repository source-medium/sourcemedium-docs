*Note: Most modules in your SourceMedium dashboard allow for a change in time granularity (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) and can be altered at your request. We do not provide custom time calculations at this time (i.e. fiscal, rolling weeks, etc).*
### How to check SourceMedium dashboard data accuracy ###
If your data doesn't match or seems inaccurate against external sources, such as an agency or another reporting software, please take time to consider the common discrepancies below:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Shopify Reports">
If you have requested to `exclude $0 net revenue orders` then your gross revenue, total revenue, discounts, and refunds will not match Shopify numbers
        
*Non-U.S. store specific*: If your store settings are set `taxes included` then revenue may be off. You can work with our dev team to align this correctly in our data model
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Facebook Reports">
Check using a 7-day attribution window. This is the default for all SourceMedium customers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Google Ads Reports">
Check using the attribution window set in your account and only count *purchase* conversions and revenue. This is the default for all SourceMedium customers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Minor discrepancies with recent days (eg past 7 days)">
Often caused by Facebook or Google dynamically taking credit for purchases happening within the day using the attribution window set in the account. These numbers are reconciled daily at 1:00 AM PST, when data is ingested to SourceMedium.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
SourceMedium is Source of Truth reporting, which means the data that is surfaced is pulled raw from the data source/platform, transformed, and then provided for the BI layer (Looker Studio dashboard, or BYOBI)
