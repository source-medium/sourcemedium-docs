The Executive Summary is designed to mirror the accounting rules present in the Shopify Sales Report, and will almost always match 1:1.  However, there are some instances where you won't see a 1:1 match:

1. If your brand has our **'Exclude \$0 Orders' feature** enabled, you will see a revenue and orders mismatch.  This feature excludes orders with a `total revenue` of \$0 from all Executive Summary and Retention dashboard data.  If you're unsure if you have this feature enabled, reach out to our Support team in Slack or via email at support@sourcemedium.com.

     - [See here for a deeper explanation of this feature](https://www.notion.so/Exclude-0-Orders-feature-what-s-it-for-cb55795a3e694a2bb019181502f8f6e7?pvs=21)

2. If your brand has **any data cleaning rules in the Channel Mapping tab your Configuration Sheet**-- e.g. any rules routing orders to a channel other than Online DTC -- you will see a mismatch if only Online DTC is selected in the `channel` dropdown (located at the top right-hand corner of your report, under the date range filter).

     - **If you are running sales through Amazon, be sure to deselect "Amazon" in the `channel` dropdown** when comparing sales data between the Executive Summary and Shopify Sales report.
