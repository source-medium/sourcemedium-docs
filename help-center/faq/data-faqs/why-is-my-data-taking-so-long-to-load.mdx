If your SourceMedium dashboard isn't showing data yet, or you're waiting longer than expected, here's what's likely happening.

## The short answer

**Data volume determines ingestion time.** The more historical data your store has, the longer full ingestion takes. Your SourceMedium contact can give you a specific estimate based on your data volume.

## What affects ingestion time?

The main factors are:

- **Order count** — The primary driver. More orders = more data to process.
- **Line items per order** — Stores with high average cart sizes have more data per order.
- **Customer count** — A large customer database adds to total data volume.
- **Historical depth** — 10 years of data takes longer than 2 years.

## What can I do?

### Check with your SourceMedium contact

They can give you a status update and estimated completion time.

### Consider a phased approach

If you have a specific go-live deadline and your data volume is very high, we can discuss starting with recent data (e.g., last 1-2 years) while full history loads in the background.

<Warning>
**Trade-off:** Starting with partial history means LTV calculations will only reflect the loaded period. A customer who first purchased 5 years ago would appear as a "new" customer if we only loaded 2 years. Once full history loads, everything updates automatically.
</Warning>

### For future onboardings

If you manage multiple stores or brands, running a [Data Volume Assessment](/onboarding/getting-started/data-volume-assessment) before integration helps set accurate timeline expectations upfront.
