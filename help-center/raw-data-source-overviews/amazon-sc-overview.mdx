SourceMedium integrates Amazon Seller Central data to support unified omnichannel reporting alongside DTC channels.

## What we ingest

- Orders and sales reporting (including historical backfill, where available)
- Refunds/returns (with platform-specific reporting delays)
- Product identifiers and order-level metadata used for reporting

## Common caveats

- Amazon reporting often has delays and retroactive changes (especially for FBA returns).
- Historical reporting can differ from real-time/enriched feeds depending on what Amazon exposes.
