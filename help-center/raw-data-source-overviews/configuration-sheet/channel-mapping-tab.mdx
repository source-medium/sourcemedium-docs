The Channel Mapping tab in the SourceMedium Configuration Sheet is where you define how orders and marketing activity should be routed into consistent **channels** and **subchannels**.

## What this tab impacts

- Channel-level reporting in dashboards
- Reconciling across platforms (e.g., Shopify vs dashboard) when filtering by channel
- Segmentation for new vs repeat customers and product performance
