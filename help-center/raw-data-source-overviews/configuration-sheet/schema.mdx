This page is a **reference spec** for the SourceMedium Configuration Sheet: what columns exist on each tab, which fields are required, and how dates/ranges are interpreted during ingestion.

<Info>
Your Configuration Sheet is shared during onboarding (email + Slack) and is typically synced into SourceMedium within 24 hours.

## General rules

### Date formats

Different tabs parse dates differently:

- **Targets / Sales / Cost (Marketing Costs)**: dates are parsed from common string formats, including:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `MM-DD-YYYY`
  - `MM/DD/YYYY`
  - `MM/DD/YY`
- **Financial Cost tabs**: `date_start` / `date_end` are parsed as `MM/DD/YYYY` specifically.

### Date ranges

- Where a tab supports a date range, `date_end` is treated as **inclusive** (the range includes both `date_start` and `date_end`).
- For tabs that amortize/spread amounts, the spread is done evenly across the number of days in the inclusive range.

---

## Targets tab

Use the Targets tab for KPI targets displayed in scorecards and executive reporting.

<Note>
Targets are treated as **daily values** across the selected date range. If you want a monthly total target, enter the per-day target value.
</Note>

<Note>
If multiple Target rows overlap on the same day for the same channel:
- Summable metrics (e.g., revenue, orders, spend, sessions) are **summed**
- Ratio-like metrics (e.g., AOV, CPA, ROAS) use the **max** value for that day
</Note>

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| `channel` | STRING | Yes | Targets are keyed by channel. |
| `date_start` | STRING | Yes | Parsed into a date. |
| `date_end` | STRING | No | If provided, targets apply to each day in the inclusive range. |
| `gross_revenue` | FLOAT64 | No | Target value (per day if using a range). |
| `net_revenue` | FLOAT64 | No | Target value (per day if using a range). |
| `total_revenue` | FLOAT64 | No | Target value (per day if using a range). |
| `orders` | FLOAT64 | No | Target value (per day if using a range). |
| `spend` | FLOAT64 | No | Target value (per day if using a range). |
| `sessions` | FLOAT64 | No | Target value (per day if using a range). |
| `aov` | FLOAT64 | No | Ratio/derived KPI targets are applied as a constant value across the range. |
| `cpa` | FLOAT64 | No | Ratio/derived KPI targets are applied as a constant value across the range. |
| `cpo` | FLOAT64 | No | Ratio/derived KPI targets are applied as a constant value across the range. |
| `conversion_rate` | FLOAT64 | No | Ratio/derived KPI targets are applied as a constant value across the range. |
| `roas` | FLOAT64 | No | Ratio/derived KPI targets are applied as a constant value across the range. |
| `primary_product_units` | NUMERIC | No | Optional (brand-dependent). |

## Channel Mapping tab

Use Channel Mapping to route orders (and some marketing records) into consistent **channels**, **subchannels**, and **vendors** using rule-based matching.

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| `row` | INT64 | Yes | Rule priority. Higher values are evaluated first. `0` disables a row. |
| `attribute` | STRING | Yes | Which input field to match against. |
| `operator` | STRING | Yes | One of: `equals`, `contains`, `in` (must match exactly). |
| `value` | STRING | Yes | Match value (comparison is case-insensitive). For `in`, use a comma-separated list (whitespace is ignored). |
| `channel` | STRING | No | Optional output channel when matched. |
| `sub_channel` | STRING | No | Optional output subchannel when matched. |
| `vendor` | STRING | No | Optional output vendor when matched. |
| `cost_per_order` | FLOAT64 | No | Optional CPO value associated with the matched rule. |

<Info>
Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest derived **weight**. In addition to `row`, some non-default channels are intentionally boosted to win over lower-priority “online” rules.
</Info>

### Supported `attribute` values

These attributes are supported by the channel mapping ingestion logic:

- `source` (UTM source)
- `medium` (UTM medium)
- `source_medium` (combined UTM source/medium)
- `campaign` (UTM campaign)
- `discount_codes` (order discount codes)
- `order_tags` (order tags)
- `skus` (product SKUs)
- `shopify_sales_channel` (Shopify sales channel / marketplace signal)

## Sales tab

Use the Sales tab to enter **non-integrated sales** and have them included in reporting.

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| `channel` | STRING | Yes | Sales channel bucket for the entry. |
| `sub_channel` | STRING | No | Optional label for internal organization. |
| `date_start` | STRING | Yes | Parsed into a date. |
| `date_end` | STRING | No | If provided, amounts are spread evenly across the inclusive range. |
| `gross_revenue` | FLOAT64 | No | Total for the period (spread evenly if `date_end` provided). |
| `net_revenue` | FLOAT64 | No | Total for the period (spread evenly if `date_end` provided). |
| `orders` | FLOAT64 | No | Total for the period (spread evenly if `date_end` provided). |
| `primary_product_units` | NUMERIC | No | Optional (brand-dependent). |
| `discounts` | FLOAT64 | No | Total for the period (spread evenly if `date_end` provided). |
| `refunds` | FLOAT64 | No | Total for the period (spread evenly if `date_end` provided). |

<Note>
Orders are stored as whole numbers; when a Sales row spans multiple days, order counts are distributed across the range to stay integer-valued.
</Note>

## Cost tab (Marketing Costs)

Use the Cost tab (sometimes labeled **Marketing Costs**) for marketing spend that isn’t captured by an integration.

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| `category` | STRING | Yes | Used to categorize spend (commonly `Marketing`). |
| `channel` | STRING | Yes | Channel where you want reporting to reflect spend. |
| `sub_channel` | STRING | No | Optional subchannel. |
| `vendor` | STRING | No | Optional platform/vendor. |
| `cost` | FLOAT64 | Yes | Total cost for the period. |
| `date_start` | STRING | Yes | Parsed into a date. |
| `date_end` | STRING | No | If provided, cost is spread evenly across the inclusive range. |

## Financial Cost tabs

Financial Cost tabs define rates used for profit and cost reporting. These tabs require `date_start` and `date_end` and parse dates as **`MM/DD/YYYY`**.

<Warning>
For Financial Cost tabs, rows without a `date_end` are ignored.
</Warning>
