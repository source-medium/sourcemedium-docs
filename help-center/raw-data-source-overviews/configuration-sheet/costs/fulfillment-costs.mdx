Fulfillment costs cover the fees charged by 3PLs, fulfillment centers, and warehouses to pick, pack, and ship your orders.

## What Are Fulfillment Costs?

Fulfillment costs include:
- **Pick and pack fees**: Per-order handling charges
- **Storage fees**: Monthly warehouse storage
- **3PL fees**: ShipBob, Deliverr, Amazon FBA, etc.
- **Packaging materials**: Boxes, tape, inserts

<Note>
Fulfillment costs are separate from shipping costs (carrier fees). Both contribute to your total cost to fulfill an order.

## Common Approaches
