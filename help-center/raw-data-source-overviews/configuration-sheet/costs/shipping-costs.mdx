Shipping costs represent the cost you pay to deliver orders to customers. Adding shipping costs enables accurate gross profit and contribution margin calculations.

## How Shipping Costs Work

Shipping costs can be entered as:
- **Flat rate per order**: Same cost for every order
- **Percentage of shipping revenue**: e.g., 80% of what customer paid
- **Per-order values**: Custom cost per order via upload

## Where Shipping Costs Appear

## Setting Up Shipping Costs

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your method">
    Choose flat rate, percentage, or upload order-level costs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Approaches

| Approach | Best For | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Flat rate** | Simple, consistent shipping | $5.00 per order |
| **Percentage** | Variable shipping costs | 75% of shipping charged |
| **Per-order upload** | Complex/negotiated rates | CSV with order-specific costs |

<Tip>
If you use multiple carriers with different rates, consider using the average cost across all orders. You can refine later with per-order data.
