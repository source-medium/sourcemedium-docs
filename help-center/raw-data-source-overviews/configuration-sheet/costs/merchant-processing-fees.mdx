Merchant processing fees are the costs charged by payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify Payments) to process customer payments.

## What Are Merchant Processing Fees?

These fees typically include:
- **Transaction fees**: Percentage of transaction (e.g., 2.9%)
- **Fixed fees**: Per-transaction fee (e.g., $0.30)
- **Gateway fees**: Monthly/per-transaction gateway costs
- **Chargeback fees**: Fees for disputed transactions

<Info>
Processing fees vary by payment method. Credit cards typically cost more than ACH/bank transfers.
