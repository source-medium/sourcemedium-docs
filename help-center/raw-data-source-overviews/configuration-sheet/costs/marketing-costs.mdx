Marketing costs entered via the Configuration Sheet ensure your reporting includes **complete spend**—including sources that aren't directly integrated with SourceMedium.

## Why Add Marketing Costs Manually?

SourceMedium integrates with major ad platforms (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.), but some spend sources require manual entry:

| Source Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Influencer spend** | Creator payments, gifting costs |
| **Podcast ads** | Sponsorships, host-read ads |
| **Affiliate payouts** | Commission payments |
| **Traditional media** | TV, radio, print |
| **Offline marketing** | Events, direct mail |

<Warning>
If you have significant untracked spend, your blended ROAS and CPA metrics will be inflated. Adding all spend gives you accurate efficiency metrics.
</Warning>

## Where Marketing Costs Appear

| Module | Impact |
