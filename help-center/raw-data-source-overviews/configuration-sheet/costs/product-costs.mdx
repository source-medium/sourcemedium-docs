Product costs (COGS) power profitability metrics like gross profit and contribution margin across your SourceMedium dashboards.

## How Product Costs Work

SourceMedium pulls product costs from Shopify's `Cost per item` field at the variant level. This enables:
- **Order-level profitability**: Gross profit per order
- **Customer-level LTV**: Profit-based lifetime value
- **Product-level margins**: Gross margin by product/collection

<Info>
SourceMedium tracks cost changes over time. Orders use the product cost that was active when the order was placed.

| Module | Cost Usage |

| Executive Summary | Gross profit, contribution margin |

| Orders Deep Dive | Order-level profitability |

## FAQs

  <Accordion title="What should I include in product cost?">
    Use **landed cost**: product cost + inbound shipping + duties/tariffs. This gives the most accurate gross margin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle cost changes over time?">
    Update the cost in Shopify when it changes. SourceMedium tracks historical costs—old orders keep old costs, new orders use new costs.
