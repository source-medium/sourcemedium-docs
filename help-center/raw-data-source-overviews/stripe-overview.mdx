SourceMedium can ingest Stripe to support payment-level and subscription revenue analysis.

## Setup

- [Stripe integration instructions](/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/stripe-integration)

## Common caveats

- Stripe is payment-centric; ecommerce reporting is typically order-centric. Align on the question before validating.
- Metadata mapping can affect how transactions are categorized.
