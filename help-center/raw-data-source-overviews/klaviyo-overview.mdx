SourceMedium integrates Klaviyo to support email and SMS performance analysis.

## Setup

- [Klaviyo integration instructions](/data-inputs/platform-integration-instructions/klaviyo-integration)

## Common caveats

- Email/SMS attribution depends heavily on consistent UTM tagging.
- Platform-reported conversions can differ from warehouse-reconciled revenue due to attribution windows and deduplication.
