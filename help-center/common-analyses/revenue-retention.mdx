Use this guide to measure **how much revenue you retain** from existing customers over time.

## Recommended tables

- Orders: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)
- Customers: [`obt_customers`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_customers)

## Define revenue retention (pick one)

- **Gross revenue retention (GRR):** how much existing-customer revenue remains, excluding expansion
- **Net revenue retention (NRR):** GRR + expansion from existing customers

The exact definition depends on your business (subscription vs non-subscription). Write the definition down before you compute it.

## Suggested workflow

1. Filter to valid orders: `is_order_sm_valid = TRUE`.
2. Choose a baseline window (e.g., customers who purchased in a given month).
3. Track subsequent revenue from that same customer set across future periods.
4. Segment by acquisition channel, first product, or subscription status to identify drivers.

## Common pitfalls

- Mixing subscription and one-time revenue in a single metric without clear separation.
- Comparing cohorts at different maturity.
