Use this guide to understand **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** at global, channel, and campaign levels using SourceMedium data.

## What is ROAS?

ROAS measures the revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising:

```
ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
```

A ROAS of 3.0 means you earned $3 in revenue for every $1 spent on ads.

## Where to find ROAS in SourceMedium

### Executive Summary
The [Executive Summary module](/data-activation/managed-bi-v1/modules/executive-summary-module) shows global ROAS across all paid channels.

### Marketing Overview
The [Marketing Overview module](/data-activation/managed-bi-v1/modules/marketing-overview-module) breaks down ROAS by channel (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.).

### Ad Performance table
For granular analysis, use [`rpt_ad_performance_daily`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/rpt_ad_performance_daily):
- `ad_spend` — Total spend
- `ad_platform_reported_revenue` — Revenue attributed to ads (as reported by the ad platform)
- Calculate: `ad_platform_reported_revenue / ad_spend`

## ROAS by attribution model

You’ll see ROAS reflected in a few different ways depending on the view you’re using:

- **Platform-reported ROAS:** best for reconciling to Meta/Google/TikTok reporting, using `rpt_ad_performance_daily` (spend and platform-reported revenue).
- **Dashboard ROAS (blended / channel-level):** best for high-level planning, shown in Executive Summary and Marketing Overview.
- **MTA ROAS (if enabled):** best for multi-touch analysis, covered in the MTA documentation.

<Tip>
If your ROAS looks different from in-platform reporting, it's usually due to attribution windows or revenue definitions. See [attribution windows FAQ](/help-center/faq/data-faqs/what-attribution-windows-does-sourcemedium-report-on-for-marketing-platforms).

## Common ROAS analyses

### 1. Channel comparison
Compare ROAS across channels to understand efficiency:
- Which channels drive the best return?
- Are you over-investing in low-ROAS channels?

### 2. ROAS trends over time
Track weekly/monthly ROAS trends:
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Spot declining efficiency early

### 3. New vs returning customer ROAS
If you have customer-level attribution:
- What's your ROAS on prospecting (new customers)?
- What's your ROAS on retargeting (returning customers)?

## Interpreting ROAS

| ROAS | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| < 1.0 | Losing money on ads (spend > revenue) |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Low efficiency; may not cover COGS/overhead |
| 2.0 - 4.0 | Typical range for many DTC brands |
| > 4.0 | Strong efficiency (validate it's not measurement error) |

<Warning>
A high ROAS isn't always good — it may indicate under-investment in growth. Balance ROAS against total revenue and new customer acquisition.
</Warning>

## Common pitfalls

- **Comparing apples to oranges**: Platform-reported ROAS uses different attribution than SourceMedium's unified view.
- **Ignoring attribution windows**: Different platforms use different default windows (e.g., Meta's 7-day click / 1-day view). Check your platform settings.
- **Looking at ROAS in isolation**: Always pair with total spend and revenue — a 10x ROAS on $100 spend is less valuable than 3x ROAS on $10,000 spend.
