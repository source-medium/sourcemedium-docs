Contribution margin extends gross profit by including additional variable costs that scale with demand (for example, marketing spend).

## What it represents

Contribution margin answers: “After variable costs, how much do we have left to cover fixed costs and profit?”

Depending on your definition, it may include:

- Gross profit components (COGS + fulfillment + fees, etc.)
- Marketing spend (paid media + other variable acquisition costs)
- Other variable operating expenses (if modeled)

## Where to look in SourceMedium

- Marketing spend: [`rpt_ad_performance_daily`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/rpt_ad_performance_daily) (and/or configuration sheet spend inputs)
- Blended order profitability: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)

## Troubleshooting

If contribution margin is unexpected:

- Confirm which spend sources are included (integrations vs config sheet)
- Confirm refunds/cancellations and the revenue definition used
