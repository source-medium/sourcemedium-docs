Use this guide to find your top-selling products and understand how product performance changes by channel and customer type.

## Recommended tables

- Order lines: [`obt_order_lines`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_order_lines)
- Orders (for filtering/segmentation): [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)

## Suggested workflow

1. Filter to valid orders (`is_order_sm_valid = TRUE`).
2. Aggregate by product (and optionally variant) to compute:
   - Orders containing product
   - Quantity sold
   - Net revenue
3. Add slices:
   - Channel (`sm_channel`)
   - New vs repeat
   - Discount codes

Tip: If you want “top converting” vs “top selling”, start from funnel events rather than order lines.
