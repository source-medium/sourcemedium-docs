Use this guide to find which products drive the most conversions and revenue, and how that changes by channel or acquisition source.

## Recommended tables

- Orders: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)
- Order lines: [`obt_order_lines`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_order_lines)

## Suggested workflow

1. Start with valid orders: `is_order_sm_valid = TRUE`.
2. Use order lines to aggregate product performance:
   - Orders containing product
   - Net revenue attributed to product lines
   - Quantity sold
3. Add slices:
   - Channel (`sm_channel`)
   - New vs repeat customer
   - Discounted vs non-discounted orders

Tip: If you’re looking for funnel-stage conversion (views → add to cart → purchase), you’ll want funnel events tables instead of order lines.
