Use this guide to assess subscription retention/churn and how subscription customers behave compared to one-time customers.

## Recommended tables

- Orders: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)
- Customers: [`obt_customers`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_customers)

## Key concepts

- Subscription orders can be flagged in `obt_orders` (e.g., `is_subscription_order`, `is_order_recurring_subscription`).
- If you’re validating against your subscription platform, start by aligning the definition of “active”, “new”, and “cancelled”.

## Suggested workflow

1. Filter to valid orders: `is_order_sm_valid = TRUE`.
2. Segment subscription vs non-subscription customers.
3. Analyze:
   - Subscription order frequency
   - Time between subscription orders
   - Churn proxy (no subscription orders in X days)
4. If you have a direct integration, reconcile key counts to the source platform.
