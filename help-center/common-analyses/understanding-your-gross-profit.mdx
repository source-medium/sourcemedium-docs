Gross profit helps you understand how much profit you generate after accounting for the variable costs required to sell and fulfill an order.

## Common components

Gross profit is typically derived from:

- Net revenue (after discounts and refunds)
- Minus product costs (COGS)
- Minus fulfillment costs
- Minus shipping costs (if modeled as a cost component)
- Minus merchant processing fees

## Where to look in SourceMedium

- Order-level profitability: [`obt_orders`](/data-activation/data-tables/sm_transformed_v2/obt_orders)
- Ensure cost inputs are present and up to date:
  - [Product costs](/help-center/raw-data-source-overviews/configuration-sheet/costs/product-costs)
  - [Fulfillment costs](/help-center/raw-data-source-overviews/configuration-sheet/costs/fulfillment-costs)
  - [Merchant processing fees](/help-center/raw-data-source-overviews/configuration-sheet/costs/merchant-processing-fees)

## Troubleshooting

If gross profit looks “off”, confirm:

- You’re using the same revenue definition across tools (gross vs net)
- Costs are populated for the same date range and channels
