One of the biggest times of year for our customers is BFCM. Here are some of the most common questions our customers ask during that period. Do you know the answers?

1. Am I acquiring new customers profitably today? How does their profitability potential compare vs. non-sale periods?
2. What were the top performing acquisition channels for new customers? For repeat customers (were they low cost-channels)?
3. Did my marketing mix optimize my contribution margin potential (e.g. the gross profit on all orders - marketing costs)?
4. Was I able to scale my spend (vs. baseline) profitably?
5. Did I incentivize the right type of purchasers during the sale period? (e.g. first timers, subscribers, higher AOV)
6. How did I perform across my sales channels (DTC, Amazon)?

Here are some additional helpful video tips as you prepare for your BFCM season.
