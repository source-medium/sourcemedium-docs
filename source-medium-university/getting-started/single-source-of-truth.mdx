## 3. Customizable Executive dashboards

Source Medium is similar to a set of lego blocks. Our Executive dashboards are flexible based on the needs of your business; we can rearrange, swap out, or create new metrics and visualizations using the proprietary Source Medium data layer. Our Customer Solutions Analysts are dedicated to helping members of your team raise analytical questions and surface the right actionable metrics. Our constantly expanding Template Gallery provides inspirations for visualizations we have co-designed with our customers.

Monthly scorecards are a way for teams to track their progress on certain KPIs and can be modified depending on different business stakeholder needs — ranging from growth marketing teams, agencies, to executive level updates.

## 4. Source Medium’s key features

While there are plenty of data visualization and reporting solutions out in the market, Source Medium’s differentiation is in our customer first approach to asking and solving analytical questions. Source Medium will:

- Understand your **product performance** on a product or SKU level, as well as products most commonly purchased together. 
- Get a clear understanding of your **influencer performance and ROI** with a custom influencer tracking solution
- Continue to grow our data connection footprint to meet your **omni-channel needs** with insightful and actionable data
- Receive **customized reports emailed** on a schedule that works for you
- Actionable **daily Slack sales reporting** on key business metrics

## 5. Asking analytical questions 

The foundation of Source Medium is to empower analytically minded teams that are willing to ask questions about business performance. We have witnessed that as teams begin to build the neural pathways to ask and answer certain questions, Source Medium usage moves beyond the summary level statistics to advanced deep dives and customizations. 

Some of the early common analytical questions we’ve noticed include: 

### Which marketing channels are driving repeat purchases?

### What percentage of my orders are first time vs. repeat? What percentage of my subscription orders are first time vs. repeat?

### Are my cohorts profitable relative to my blended cost per acquisition?

### How many new customers are coming from subscription vs. non-subscription orders?

### How many customers are on a given order number across my most recent sales? How many days do customers wait between successive purchases?

### How many customers are converting from a particular Source / Medium and re-converting from the same or different Source / Medium?

## Our proprietary customer data model has the widest coverage for lack-click UTM attribution channels which we supplement with other attribution points such as zero party data.
