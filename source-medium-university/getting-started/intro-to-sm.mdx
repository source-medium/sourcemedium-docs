### 3. Customizable Executive dashboards

SourceMedium is similar to a set of lego blocks. Our Executive dashboards are flexible based on the needs of your business; we can rearrange, swap out, or create new metrics and visualizations using the proprietary SourceMedium data layer. Our Customer Solutions Analysts are dedicated to helping members of your team raise analytical questions and surface the right actionable metrics. Our constantly expanding [**Template Gallery**](https://help.sourcemedium.com/articles/template-gallery) provides inspirations for visualizations we have co-designed with our customers.

### 5. Asking analytical questions

The foundation of SourceMedium is to empower analytically minded teams that are willing to ask questions about business performance. We have witnessed that as teams begin to build the neural pathways to ask and answer certain questions, SourceMedium usage moves beyond the summary level statistics to advanced deep dives and customizations. 

Some of the early common analytical questions we’ve noticed include: 

**Which marketing channels are driving repeat purchases?**
