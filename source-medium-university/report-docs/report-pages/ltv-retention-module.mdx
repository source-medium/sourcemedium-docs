#### What is the LTV & Retention module and what data can be found there?
    - This report uses cohorts to bucket customers based on the month a customer placed their very first order. Inclusion in a cohort and applied filters are based on a customer's acquisition order. For example, when filtering using a discount code a customer will be included in a cohort for the month in which they first used that specific discount code.
    - The ***Slice filter*** is based on Subscription, One-time, or All Product sales.  
        - *e.g. filtering to Subscription will not show any One-Time revenue, even if a given customer has purchased both one-time and subscription products in different orders or the same order.*

#### Potential Reporting Differences & Discrepancies
    - Defaulted to **Net Revenue**
    - Filters (order type, sub-channel, etc.) apply to customers' **acquisition order**
    - Cohorts based on `order_process` date when the order is at least partially paid
    - If we do not have a direct integration with a subscription platform, we rely on tags to determine subscription vs. non-subscription order type
