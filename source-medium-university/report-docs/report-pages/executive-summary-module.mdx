#### Potential Reporting Differences & Discrepancies
    The Executive Summary is designed to mirror the accounting rules present in the Shopify Sales Report, and will almost always match 1:1.  However, there are some instances where you won't see a 1:1 match:
    
    1. If your brand has our 'Exclude \$0 Orders' feature enabled, you will see a revenue and orders mismatch. This feature excludes orders with a total revenue of \$0 from all Executive Summary and Retention dashboard data. If you're unsure if you have this feature enabled, reach out to our Support team in Slack or via email at [help@sourcemedium.com](mailto:help@sourcemedium.com).
        - [See here for a deeper explanation of this feature.](/help-center/faq/dashboard-functionality-faqs/what-is-exclude-$0-feature)
    
    2. If your brand has any data cleaning rules in the Channel Mapping tab your Configuration Sheet *(e.g. any rules routing orders to a channel other than Online DTC)* you will see a mismatch if only Online DTC is selected in the channel dropdown (located at the top right-hand corner of your report, under the date range filter).
    
    **If you are running sales through Amazon, be sure to deselect "Amazon" in the channel dropdown when comparing sales data between the Executive Summary and Shopify Sales report.**
