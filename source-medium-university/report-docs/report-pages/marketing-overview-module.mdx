#### Potential Reporting Differences & Discrepancies
    - SourceMedium reports strictly on 7-day click attribution so if your Facebook attribution window is set to something else, it will look like there is a discrepancy in the Facebook reporting vs. SourceMedium dashboard.
    - SourceMedium separates **Campaign Types** based on common Campaign naming conventions, which can be modified if our logic does not pick up the correct categorization.
