The AI Analyst lets you ask questions about your e-commerce data in plain English. It understands your question, finds the right data, writes SQL, and returns results with visualizations — all within Slack.

## How It Works

When you ask a question, the AI Analyst:

1. **Classifies your question** — Determines whether you need data analysis, a definition, or a diagnostic check
2. **Identifies relevant tables** — Finds the right data sources for your question
3. **Generates SQL** — Writes a query against your BigQuery warehouse
4. **Executes and visualizes** — Runs the query and creates a chart if appropriate

<Info>
The AI Analyst queries your actual data in BigQuery. Results reflect your real business metrics, not sample data.
</Info>

## What You Can Ask

The AI Analyst handles three types of questions:

### Data Questions

Questions that require querying your warehouse:

- "What was our revenue last week?"
- "Show me top 10 products by units sold this month"
- "How many new customers did we acquire in January?"
- "What's our average order value by channel?"

### Definitions & Schema

Questions about metrics, tables, data structure, and how SourceMedium works:

- "What is LTV?"
- "How is conversion rate calculated?"
- "Which table has order data?"
- "What columns are in the customers table?"
- "How does attribution work in SourceMedium?"
- "What's the difference between first-click and last-click attribution?"

<Tip>
For these questions, the AI Analyst draws from [docs.sourcemedium.com](https://docs.sourcemedium.com) to provide accurate, up-to-date answers — no SQL required.
</Tip>

### Diagnostics

Health checks for your data and tracking:

- "How is my data health?" — Check table freshness and availability
- "How is my attribution health?" — Check UTM tracking coverage

## Analytical Domains

The AI Analyst can query data across these domains:

| Domain | What You Can Analyze |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Orders & Revenue** | Revenue, AOV, order counts, discounts, shipping |
| **Customers** | New vs. repeat, cohort analysis, customer-level metrics |
| **Marketing** | Ad spend, ROAS, CPO, channel performance |
| **Email & SMS** | Campaign performance, engagement metrics |
| **Web Analytics** | Funnel events, page views, conversion paths |
| **Cohort LTV** | Lifetime value by acquisition cohort |
| **Attribution** | Multi-touch attribution, channel contribution |

---

## Analysis Workflows

The AI Analyst uses different workflows depending on your question type:

| Question Type | Workflow |
|--------------|----------|
| Specific metrics | [Standard Analysis](/ai-analyst/workflows/standard) |
| Open-ended/strategic | [Deep Analysis](/ai-analyst/workflows/deep-analysis) |
| Definitions & schema | [Knowledge Retrieval](/ai-analyst/workflows/knowledge) |

<Card title="Learn about Workflows" icon="diagram-project" href="/ai-analyst/workflows">
  Understand how different question types are routed and processed.
</Card>

### Deep Analysis

For complex, open-ended questions — like "How can we improve our marketing performance?" or "What trends should we be aware of?" — the AI Analyst automatically engages **Deep Analysis**.

In this mode, the AI breaks your question into multiple analytical perspectives, runs parallel Standard Analyses, and synthesizes the findings into a comprehensive answer.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the app">
    Visit your tenant URL (`https://{your-tenant}.sourcemedium.com/slack/install`) and click "Add to Slack" to install the AI Analyst in your workspace. See [Setup & Installation](/ai-analyst/setup) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite to a channel">
    Add the bot to a channel where you want to ask questions, or send it a direct message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask a question">
    Type your question in natural language. Be specific about time ranges and metrics when possible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    The AI Analyst returns a response with data, a chart (if applicable), and the SQL query used.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What It Can't Do

The AI Analyst is designed for analytics questions against your SourceMedium data. It cannot:

- Access systems outside your BigQuery warehouse
- Modify data or run write operations
- Answer questions unrelated to your e-commerce analytics
- Guarantee real-time data (see [Data Health](/ai-analyst/diagnostics/data-health) for freshness)
- Access custom tables or customized logic built on top of SourceMedium data

---

## Data Access & Security

### Data Access Scope

Currently, the AI Analyst has access only to **SourceMedium out-of-the-box transformed tables**. If you have built custom tables or added customized logic on top of our data within your BigQuery instance, the agent will not have visibility into those for now.

<Note>
Support for custom tables and user-defined schemas is planned for a future update.
</Note>

### Access Control

The AI Analyst operates at the **tenant level**. This means:

- **Full Tenant Visibility**: Anyone within your Slack workspace who has access to the bot can query any data available in the SourceMedium tables for your tenant.
- **Multi-Store Organizations**: If your tenant includes multiple stores, the bot can query data across all of them.

<Warning>
Granular access control (limiting specific users to specific stores or tables) is not yet available but is on our roadmap.
</Warning>
