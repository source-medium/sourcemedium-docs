Agent Skills package repeatable workflows that help coding agents assist with SourceMedium data analysis.

## Quick Start (Copy/Paste)

Give this prompt to your coding agent to install everything automatically:

<Tip>
Copy the block below and paste it into Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any skills-compatible agent.
</Tip>

```
Install the SourceMedium BigQuery analyst skill and help me verify my setup:

1. Run: npx skills add source-medium/skills@v1.0.0
2. Run the setup verification commands from the skill
3. Confirm my BigQuery access is working

My BigQuery project ID is: [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
```

---

## Install Options

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Install all skills (pinned version)
npx skills add source-medium/skills@v1.0.0

# Install specific skill
npx skills add source-medium/skills@v1.0.0 --skill sm-bigquery-analyst
```

<Note>
We recommend pinning to a specific version (`@v1.0.0`) to avoid surprise behavior changes. See [github.com/source-medium/skills/releases](https://github.com/source-medium/skills/releases) for available versions.
</Note>

The CLI detects your installed agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and installs to all of them.

### Option 2: Manual Copy/Paste

1. Go to [SM BigQuery Analyst](/ai-analyst/agent-skills/sm-bigquery-analyst)
2. Copy the `SKILL.md` content
3. Create `.claude/skills/sm-bigquery-analyst/SKILL.md` in your project

## After Installing

Once installed, ask your coding agent questions like:

```
What was my revenue by channel last month?
```

```
Show me new customer acquisition by source over the past 30 days
```

```
What's my customer LTV by cohort?
```

Your agent will:
1. Verify your BigQuery access
2. Generate the correct SQL
3. Return an auditable "SQL receipt" you can verify
