Agent Skills package repeatable workflows that help coding agents assist with SourceMedium data analysis.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://docs.sourcemedium.com
```

The CLI detects your installed agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and installs the skills.

## Available Skills

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="SM BigQuery Analyst" icon="database" href="/ai-analyst/agent-skills/sm-bigquery-analyst">
    Query SourceMedium BigQuery safely with SQL receipts. SELECT-only, cost-guarded.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Two Versions

Each skill has two variants:

| Version | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `sm-bigquery-analyst` | Auto-loaded by agents when relevant |
| `sm-bigquery-analyst-manual` | Requires explicit `/sm-bigquery-analyst-manual` invocation |

Choose the manual version if you want full control over when queries run.

## Manual Install (Copy/Paste)

If you prefer to copy files manually:

1. Click on a skill above
2. Copy the `SKILL.md` content from the page
3. Paste it into your coding agent's skills folder (e.g., `.claude/skills/sm-bigquery-analyst/SKILL.md` for Claude Code)
