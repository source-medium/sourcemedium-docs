Agent Skills package repeatable workflows that help coding agents assist with SourceMedium data analysis.

## Quick Start (Copy/Paste)

Give this prompt to your coding agent to install everything automatically:

<Tip>
Copy the block below and paste it into Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any skills-compatible agent.
</Tip>

```
Install the SourceMedium BigQuery analyst skill and help me verify my setup:

1. Run: npx skills add source-medium/skills --skill sm-bigquery-analyst
2. Run the setup verification commands from the skill
3. Confirm my BigQuery access is working

My tenant ID is: [your-tenant-id]
My project is: sm-[your-tenant-id]
```

---

## Install

```bash
npx skills add source-medium/skills --skill sm-bigquery-analyst
```

The CLI detects your installed agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and installs to all of them.

## After Installing

Once installed, ask your coding agent questions like:

```
What was my revenue by channel last month?
```

```
Show me new customer acquisition by source over the past 30 days
```

```
What's my customer LTV by cohort?
```

Your agent will:
1. Verify your BigQuery access
2. Generate the correct SQL
3. Return an auditable "SQL receipt" you can verify
