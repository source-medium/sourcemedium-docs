## Results Don't Match Expectations

### The numbers seem wrong

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the date range in the SQL">
    Review the generated SQL query. The AI Analyst may have interpreted your time range differently than you intended. "Last week" could mean the previous 7 days or the previous calendar week.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the metric definition">
    Confirm the AI used the metric you expected. "Revenue" might be gross or net depending on context. Check the SQL to see exactly what was summed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Data Health">
    Ask "How is my data health?" — if the relevant tables are stale, recent data may be missing from results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### High (direct) / (none) in results

This indicates an attribution issue, not a query issue. The AI Analyst is correctly reflecting what's in your data.

## The AI Misunderstood My Question

### It answered a different question

Rephrase with more specificity:

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "How are we doing?" | "What was our revenue last 30 days vs. the previous 30 days?" |
| "Show me sales" | "Show me daily order count for the past 2 weeks" |
| "Best products" | "Top 10 products by revenue this month" |

### It used the wrong table

If the AI queried the wrong data source, clarify the domain:

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "Show me performance" | "Show me ad performance by platform" |
| "Customer data" | "Show me new customer acquisition by week" |

## No Results Returned

### "No data found" or empty results

1. **Check the date range** — You may be querying a period with no activity
2. **Check filters** — The AI may have applied filters that excluded all rows
3. **Check Data Health** — The table may be empty or not yet populated for your account

### Query timed out

Complex queries against large date ranges may time out. Try:

- Narrowing the date range
- Asking for aggregated data instead of row-level details
- Breaking the question into smaller parts

---

## Chart Not Generated

The AI Analyst generates charts when visualization adds value. Charts may not appear when:

- The result is a single number (e.g., "total revenue was $142,350")
- The data structure doesn't lend itself to visualization
- There was an error generating the chart

In these cases, the data is still returned as text or a table.

---

## Slow Responses

Response time depends on:

- **Query complexity** — Aggregations across large date ranges take longer
- **Table size** — Some tables have more data than others
- **Current load** — Occasional delays during peak usage

Most queries complete within 1–2 minutes. If responses consistently take significantly longer, try simplifying your question or narrowing the scope.

## The AI Said It Can't Help

The AI Analyst is designed for e-commerce analytics questions. It will decline requests that:

- Ask about data outside your BigQuery warehouse
- Request actions (modifying data, sending emails, etc.)
- Are unrelated to analytics (general knowledge questions)

For questions about SourceMedium concepts or definitions, the AI can still help — try rephrasing as a definition or schema question.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I ask follow-up questions?">
    Not yet. Each message starts a fresh session — the AI doesn't remember previous questions in the thread. If you want to drill down, include full context in your follow-up: "Show me revenue by channel for the last 30 days" rather than "Break that down by channel."

    Conversation follow-ups are on our [roadmap](/ai-analyst/roadmap).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often does data refresh?">
    Most tables refresh daily. Our SLA guarantees fresh data through yesterday based on your reporting timezone. Today's data is not guaranteed. See [Data Health](/ai-analyst/diagnostics/data-health) for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I export the results?">
    Yes. Each response includes downloadable files: `query.sql` (the SQL used), `results.csv` (full data), and the chart image if one was generated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple people use it at once?">
    Yes. Anyone in your Slack workspace with access to the bot can ask questions simultaneously. There's no queue or limit on concurrent users.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do I see different results than my teammate?">
    You shouldn't — everyone queries the same underlying data. If results differ, check:
    - Are you asking about the same time range?
    - Are you using the same metric definition?
    - Did the data refresh between queries?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting More Help

If you're stuck:

1. **Check the SQL** — The generated query often reveals how the AI interpreted your question
2. **Try a simpler question** — Start basic, then add complexity
3. **Ask about schema** — "Which table has order data?" can help you understand the data structure
4. **Contact support** — Reach out to your SourceMedium team for persistent issues
