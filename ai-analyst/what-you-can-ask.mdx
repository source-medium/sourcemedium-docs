## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Specify time ranges explicitly">
    Instead of "recently" or "lately," use specific ranges like "last 7 days," "in January," or "Q4 2024."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Name the metric you want">
    "Revenue" is clearer than "sales." "Orders" is clearer than "transactions." Use the terminology from your dashboards.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ask one thing at a time">
    Complex multi-part questions work better as separate queries. Ask "What was our revenue last month?" then "How does that compare to the previous month?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use 'top N' for rankings">
    "Top 10 products by revenue" is specific. "Best products" is ambiguous.
  </Accordion>
