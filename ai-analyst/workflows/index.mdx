The AI Analyst uses different workflows depending on what you're asking. Each workflow is optimized for its type of question — from quick knowledge lookups to comprehensive multi-perspective analyses.

## How Questions Are Routed

When you send a message, the AI Analyst classifies it into one of three categories:

| Question Type | Workflow |
|--------------|----------|
| **Specific data requests** | [Standard Analysis](/ai-analyst/workflows/standard) |
| **Open-ended / strategic** | [Deep Analysis](/ai-analyst/workflows/deep-analysis) |
| **Definitions & concepts** | [Knowledge Retrieval](/ai-analyst/workflows/knowledge) |

The classification happens automatically based on the question's structure and intent.

## Choosing the Right Approach

### For Data Answers

Ask specific, bounded questions:

```
What was our revenue last week?
Top 10 products by units sold this month
What's our ROAS by channel for the past 30 days?
```

These trigger **Standard Analysis** for quick results.

### For Strategic Insights

Ask open-ended, exploratory questions:

```
How can we improve our marketing performance?
What trends should we be watching?
Why are our metrics declining?
```

These trigger **Deep Thinking** for comprehensive analysis.

### For Definitions & Concepts

Ask about metrics, tables, or how things work:

```
What is LTV?
How is ROAS calculated?
Which table has order data?
```

These trigger **Knowledge Retrieval** for instant documentation-backed answers.

## Workflow Comparison

| Feature | Standard | Deep Thinking | Knowledge |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Data Source** | BigQuery | BigQuery | Docs + Metadata |
| **SQL Queries** | 1 | 2–4 | 0 (usually) |
| **Parallel Execution** | No | Yes | No |
| **Charts** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Best For** | Specific metrics | Strategic questions | Learning concepts |

## How Classification Works

The AI uses contextual signals to determine the right workflow:

**Standard Analysis triggers:**
- Specific time ranges ("last week", "in January")
- Named metrics with data requests ("revenue", "orders", "ROAS")
- Rankings and comparisons ("top 10", "vs last month")
- Computed results ("by channel", "trend over time")

**Deep Thinking triggers:**
- "How can we improve..." questions
- "What should we focus on..." questions
- Trend analysis without specific bounds
- Strategy and optimization requests

**Knowledge Retrieval triggers:**
- "What is..." or "What does...mean"
- "How is X calculated?"
- "Which table has..." or "What columns..."
- Data health and attribution health questions

<Tip>
If you want to override the classification, be explicit. "Just give me the revenue numbers" will use Standard Analysis even if your phrasing might otherwise trigger Deep Thinking.
