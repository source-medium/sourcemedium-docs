When you ask a strategic or exploratory question, the AI Analyst automatically activates **Deep Analysis** — a thorough approach that runs multiple analyses in parallel before synthesizing a comprehensive answer.

## When Deep Analysis Activates

Deep Analysis is triggered automatically for **open-ended questions** — questions that don't have a single, specific answer and benefit from exploring multiple perspectives.

### Questions That Trigger Deep Analysis

```
How can we improve our marketing performance?
What trends should we be paying attention to?
Why are our metrics declining?
What opportunities am I missing?
How is our business performing overall?
What should we focus on to grow revenue?
```

These questions require the AI to:
- Consider multiple dimensions of your data
- Compare across time periods, channels, and segments
- Identify patterns that might not be obvious from a single query
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights

### Questions That Use Standard Analysis

```
What was our revenue last week?
Top 10 products by units sold
How many new customers in January?
What's our ROAS by channel?
```

Specific questions with clear metrics and time ranges use the faster [Standard Analysis](/ai-analyst/workflows/standard) workflow.

## How It Works

Deep Analysis is essentially **multiple Standard Analyses running in parallel**, with a synthesis step at the end:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Strategic Questions">
    The AI breaks your open-ended question into 2–3 specific analytical questions that together address your original query from different angles.

    **Example:** For "How can we improve marketing performance?", the AI might generate:
    - "Which channels have the best ROAS and how has that changed recently?"
    - "Which campaigns are driving new customers vs. repeat customers?"
    - "Where are we overspending relative to attributed revenue?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parallel Analysis">
    The AI runs multiple Standard Analyses simultaneously — one for your original question plus each strategic question. Each follows the full workflow: identifying tables, writing SQL, executing queries, and analyzing results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Synthesize Insights">
    After all analyses complete, the AI synthesizes the findings into a cohesive response:
    - Key insights from each perspective
    - Patterns that emerged across the analyses
    - Specific recommendations backed by data
    - Relevant charts and data tables
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You'll See

When Deep Analysis is active, the AI Analyst shows progress through each phase:

| Status | What's Happening |
|--------|------------------|
| 🔍 Understanding your question | Classifying and determining the analysis approach |
| 🧠 Deep Analysis activated | Open-ended question detected, entering multi-perspective mode |
| 🧠 Generating strategic questions | Breaking down your question into analytical angles |
| 🔄 Running parallel analyses | Executing multiple SQL queries simultaneously |
| ✨ Synthesizing insights | Combining results into a comprehensive answer |

<Note>
Deep Analysis takes longer than Standard Analysis but provides richer, more actionable insights.
</Note>

## Example: Deep Analysis in Action

**Question:** "How can we improve our marketing performance?"

**What Deep Analysis Does:**

1. **Generates strategic sub-questions:**
   - "Which channels have the highest and lowest ROAS over the past 30 days?"
   - "What's the new customer acquisition cost by channel?"
   - "Which campaigns are underperforming relative to spend?"

2. **Runs parallel analyses** for each question, querying:
   - Ad performance data by channel
   - Customer acquisition metrics
   - Campaign-level ROAS and spend

3. **Synthesizes findings:**
   > "Your Meta campaigns are delivering 3.2x ROAS, outperforming Google Ads at 1.8x. However, Google is driving 40% of new customer acquisitions at a lower CAC ($32 vs $45). Consider reallocating 15% of Meta budget to Google's top-performing campaigns to balance immediate ROAS with customer acquisition."

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be genuinely open-ended">
    Deep Analysis works best when your question truly requires exploration. "What should I focus on?" is better than "Show me revenue" for triggering multi-perspective analysis.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add context when helpful">
    "How can we improve Q1 performance given we're launching a new product line?" gives the AI useful context for generating relevant strategic questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Follow up in the thread">
    After a Deep Analysis, ask follow-up questions in the same thread. The AI retains context and can dive deeper into specific findings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trust the process">
    Deep Analysis takes longer but surfaces insights you might not get from a single query. The synthesis phase is where the real value emerges.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

- **Scope:** Currently limited to 2–3 parallel analyses to balance depth with speed
- **Visualizations:** Charts are generated for the synthesized response, not each individual analysis

<Info>
If you need a quick, specific answer, phrase your question to avoid Deep Analysis. "What was our Meta ROAS last month?" will return faster than "How is Meta performing?"
