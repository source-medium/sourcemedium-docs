When the AI Analyst answers your question, it returns a structured response with multiple components. This page explains what each part means and how to use it.

---

## Response Components

A typical response includes:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Answer** | Natural language summary of the results |
| **Chart** | Visual representation of the data (when applicable) |
| **Data Table** | The underlying numbers in tabular format |
| **SQL Query** | The exact query used to retrieve the data |

---

## The Answer

The AI Analyst summarizes findings in plain language. This is designed to give you the key insight without needing to parse raw data.

**Example:**

> Your total revenue last week was $142,350, down 8% from the previous week. The top channel was Paid Social at $52,100 (37% of total).

The answer prioritizes:
- The specific number you asked for
- Relevant context (comparisons, breakdowns)
- Highlighting notable patterns

---

## Charts

When your question lends itself to visualization, the AI Analyst generates a chart. Common chart types:

| Chart Type | Used For |
|------------|----------|
| **Bar chart** | Comparisons across categories (channels, products, campaigns) |
| **Line chart** | Trends over time (daily revenue, weekly orders) |
| **Table** | Detailed breakdowns with multiple metrics |

Charts are generated as images and posted directly in the Slack thread.

<Note>
If a chart doesn't appear, the AI Analyst determined the data was better presented as text or a table. This often happens for single-value answers or complex multi-dimensional data.
</Note>

## Data Tables

For questions that return multiple rows, you'll see a data table showing the raw results. This is the actual output from BigQuery, limited to a reasonable preview size.

**Example:**

| channel | revenue | orders |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Paid Social | 52,100 | 412 |
| Email | 38,200 | 298 |
| Organic Search | 28,750 | 215 |

You can download the full dataset as a CSV file attached to the response.

## The SQL Query

Every data response includes the SQL query used. This is useful for:

- **Verification** — Confirm the AI understood your question correctly
- **Learning** — See how to write similar queries yourself using SourceMedium table schemas
- **Iteration** — Copy and modify the query in BigQuery for deeper follow-up analysis

<Tip>
**Use the AI as a SQL tutor.** If you are learning BigQuery, comparing the generated SQL against our [Table Schemas](/onboarding/data-docs/dimensions) is the fastest way to master your data structure. You can copy any query directly into the BigQuery console to test your own modifications.
</Tip>

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT
  sm_default_channel AS channel,
  SUM(total_price) AS revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders
FROM `your-project.sm_transformed_v2.obt_orders`
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-08' AND '2024-01-14'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

<Tip>
If the results don't match your expectations, check the SQL to see how the AI Analyst interpreted your question. Date ranges and filters are common sources of misunderstanding.
</Tip>

## File Downloads

Responses may include downloadable files:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `query.sql` | The SQL query used |
| `results.csv` | Full data export (not truncated) |
| `chart.png` | The visualization as an image |

These files are attached to the Slack message and can be downloaded directly.

## When Things Look Wrong

If results don't match your expectations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the date range">
    Review the SQL query to confirm the time period matches your intent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the metric">
    Make sure the AI Analyst used the metric you expected (e.g., gross revenue vs. net revenue).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check data freshness">
    Ask "How is my data health?" to confirm the underlying tables are up to date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rephrase and retry">
    If the AI misunderstood, rephrase with more specificity and try again.
  </Step>
