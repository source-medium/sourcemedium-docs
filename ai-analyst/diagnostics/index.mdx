Before diving into analytics, it helps to know whether your data is complete and reliable. The AI Analyst includes built-in diagnostic checks that surface issues proactively.

## Two Types of Health Checks

| Check | What It Answers |
|-------|----------------|
| **Data Health** | Is my data fresh and available? Are tables up to date? |
| **Attribution Health** | Is my tracking working? Are marketing sources being captured? |

These checks address different concerns:

- **Data Health** is about your *data pipeline* — whether data is flowing from source systems to your warehouse
- **Attribution Health** is about your *tracking setup* — whether UTM parameters and touchpoints are being captured correctly

<Info>
A table can be perfectly fresh but still show poor attribution. Conversely, tracking can be excellent but data stale. These are independent issues with different solutions.

## When to Run Diagnostics

**Before starting an analysis:**
Ask "How is my data health?" to confirm the tables you need are current.

**When results look wrong:**
If numbers seem off, check Data Health first (is the data stale?), then Attribution Health (is tracking capturing sources correctly?).

**Proactively:**
Run diagnostics periodically to catch issues before they affect decisions.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Diagnostic | What You Learn |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| "How is my data health?" | Data Health | Table freshness, which domains are ready |
| "Which tables are fresh?" | Data Health | Specific table-level status |
| "How is my attribution health?" | Attribution Health | % of orders with attribution, tracking gaps |
| "Why is traffic showing as direct/none?" | Attribution Health | Causes of missing attribution |
