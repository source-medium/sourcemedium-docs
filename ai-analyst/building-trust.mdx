This guide explains how to validate AI Analyst results and establish a reliable workflow for using AI-generated analytics in your organization.

## Why Validation Matters

Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, platform chatbots) don't query your actual data warehouse. When you ask them analytics questions, they may:

| Issue | What Happens | Impact |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **No data access** | Tool uses estimates or asks you to provide data | Answer is a guess, not a fact |
| **Wrong data model** | Tool doesn't understand your attribution logic | Metrics don't match your actual definitions |
| **Hallucinated joins** | AI invents relationships between tables | Numbers look plausible but are fabricated |
| **Outdated context** | Tool trained on old data patterns | Doesn't reflect your current business |

## How SourceMedium AI Analyst Is Different

The AI Analyst queries your actual BigQuery warehouse:

1. **Queries your actual data** — Every answer comes from SQL executed against BigQuery
2. **Uses your data model** — Understands SourceMedium's attribution logic and metric definitions
3. **Shows its work** — You see the exact SQL query, making results auditable
4. **Validated schema** — Queries only tables and columns that exist in your warehouse

## Validation Process

Use this framework to validate AI Analyst results before relying on them for decisions.

### Step 1: Define Your Key Questions

Work with your data point of contact to identify **10-15 business questions** that matter most to your organization. These should be questions where getting the wrong answer would lead to bad decisions.

**Example key questions:**
- What was our blended ROAS last month?
- What's our 90-day LTV by acquisition channel?
- Which products have the highest repeat purchase rate?
- What's our customer acquisition cost by channel?
- How does subscription revenue compare to one-time revenue?

### Step 2: Run Questions Through AI Analyst

Ask each question to the AI Analyst and collect:
- The natural language answer
- The SQL query generated
- The raw data returned
- Any visualization produced

### Step 3: Independent Validation

Your data point of contact should **independently validate** each result:

```sql
-- Example: Validate the AI's ROAS calculation
-- 1. Review the AI-generated SQL for logical correctness
-- 2. Run the query manually in BigQuery
-- 3. Cross-check against your dashboard or known benchmarks
-- 4. Verify the time ranges and filters match your intent

SELECT
  SUM(sm_last_touch_revenue) / NULLIF(SUM(ad_spend), 0) AS roas
FROM `your_project.sm_experimental.rpt_ad_attribution_performance_daily`
WHERE sm_store_id = 'your-sm_store_id'
  AND date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE()
```

<Tip>
Focus validation on the SQL logic, not just the final number. A query can return a plausible-looking number while using the wrong joins or filters.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Score and Document

For each question, score the result:

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ✅ **Correct** | SQL logic is sound, number matches validation | Approved for org-wide use |
| ⚠️ **Partially correct** | Right approach, minor issues | Document the caveat, refine the question |
| ❌ **Incorrect** | Wrong logic or significant error | Report via feedback, do not use |

Document your validated questions as your organization's **canonical question set**. These become the questions everyone should use the AI Analyst for.

### Step 5: Establish Organizational Policy

Once your core questions are validated, establish clear guidelines:

1. **Verified numbers must be traceable to the warehouse** — Any metrics cited in reports, decisions, or external communications should come from SourceMedium dashboards or validated AI Analyst queries (both query BigQuery)

2. **Exploratory analysis can use any tool** — Quick hypothesis generation with Sidekick or ChatGPT is fine for exploration

3. **Cite your source** — When reporting numbers, indicate whether it came from a validated AI Analyst query or exploratory analysis

<Note>
**Suggested policy**: Metrics cited in business decisions should come from SourceMedium dashboards or validated AI Analyst queries. Generic AI tools are useful for exploration but should not be cited as data sources.
</Note>

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Explore** — Use any AI tool for quick hypothesis generation
2. **Verify** — Confirm findings with AI Analyst (review the SQL)
3. **Cite** — Use verified numbers in reports; keep the SQL for reproducibility

## Ongoing Validation

### Regular Re-validation
- **Monthly**: Re-run your canonical question set to catch any drift
- **After major changes**: Re-validate when you change attribution windows, add new data sources, or modify business logic

### Feedback
Every AI Analyst response includes a feedback button. Use it to report incorrect answers or flag issues—we review all feedback and use it to improve the system. See [Feedback](/ai-analyst#feedback) for details.

### Automated Evaluation (Coming Soon)
We're building tooling to automatically run your canonical questions on a schedule and alert you to changes in results.

## Summary

| Tool Type | Best For | Trust Level for Reporting |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Generic AI assistants** (ChatGPT, Gemini, platform chatbots) | Quick exploration, brainstorming | ❌ Do not cite |
| **BI dashboards** | Curated views of validated metrics | ✅ Cite (queries warehouse) |
| **SourceMedium AI Analyst** | Ad-hoc questions with SQL transparency | ✅ Cite after validation |

The goal isn't to avoid other AI tools—they're useful for exploration. The goal is to ensure **numbers that inform decisions are traceable to your warehouse**. Both SourceMedium dashboards and the AI Analyst provide this traceability.
