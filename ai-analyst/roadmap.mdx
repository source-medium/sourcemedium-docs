The AI Analyst is actively evolving. This page outlines what's available today and what's coming next across two dimensions: **where you can use it** (interfaces) and **what it can do** (capabilities).

---

## Current Capabilities

### Interface: Slack

The AI Analyst is currently available in Slack. You can ask questions in your SourceMedium channel or via direct message.

### Functionality: Ad-Hoc Questions

Today, the AI Analyst handles **on-demand questions** — you ask, it answers. This includes:

- **Straightforward queries**: "What was our revenue last week?"
- **Complex analysis**: Open-ended questions that benefit from multiple analytical perspectives
- **Definitions & schema**: "What is LTV?" or "Which table has order data?"
- **Diagnostics**: Data Health and Attribution Health checks

<Info>
For complex questions, the AI Analyst automatically engages **Deep Analysis Mode**, exploring your question from multiple angles before synthesizing a comprehensive answer.
