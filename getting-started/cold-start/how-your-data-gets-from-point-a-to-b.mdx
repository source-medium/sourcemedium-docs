Our **data model** integrates and cleans your platforms’ data into a master table that each module of the dashboard interacts with differently depending on the purpose of the module.

We use data from your sales platform (Shopify, Skio, etc) as the “source of truth” for all sales-based reporting.

<Note>
    If you notice any mismatch between your Shopify Sales Report and the dashboard, see this article for possible explanations.
</Note>

Default **data cleaning** includes separating your sales into different channels. The Channel filter on each module is defaulted to **Online DTC** (excluding Exchanged, Draft, and Wholesale orders to avoid skewing composite metrics such as Average Order Value).\
