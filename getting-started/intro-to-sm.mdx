### 3. Customizable Executive dashboards

Source Medium is similar to a set of lego blocks. Our Executive dashboards are flexible based on the needs of your business; we can rearrange, swap out, or create new metrics and visualizations using the proprietary Source Medium data layer. Our Customer Solutions Analysts are dedicated to helping members of your team raise analytical questions and surface the right actionable metrics. Our constantly expanding [**Template Gallery**](https://help.sourcemedium.com/articles/template-gallery) provides inspirations for visualizations we have co-designed with our customers. 

**Example 1**: **Setting monthly targets with Source Medium scorecards**

Monthly scorecards are a way for teams to track their progress on certain KPIs and can be modified depending on different business stakeholder needs — ranging from growth marketing teams, agencies, to executive level updates.

### 5. Asking analytical questions

The foundation of Source Medium is to empower analytically minded teams that are willing to ask questions about business performance. We have witnessed that as teams begin to build the neural pathways to ask and answer certain questions, Source Medium usage moves beyond the summary level statistics to advanced deep dives and customizations. 

Some of the early common analytical questions we’ve noticed include: 

**Which marketing channels are driving repeat purchases?**

Our `Repurchase Analysis` deep dive includes a selection of charts that depict the story of repeat orders

**What percentage of my orders are first time vs. repeat? What percentage of my subscription orders are first time vs. repeat?**
